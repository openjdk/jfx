 **            the innermost color from -fx-background-colors (e.g., 'd').    **
 **            See the -fx-text-fill entry in .scene for more information.    **
 **                                                                           **
 ** The control will also typically define pseudoclass sections for when it   **
 ** is focused, when the mouse is hovering over it ("hover") and when the     **
 ** mouse button is being held down on it (e.g., "armed").                    **
 **                                                                           **
 ** For example, in the "focused" pseudoclass, -fx-focus-color will typically **
 ** just replace -fx-shadow-highlight-color and will be drawn so it extents   **
 ** outside the control with a glowing effect.  The glowing effect is         **
 ** achieved by using a non-integer insets value of -1.4 and the radius       **
 ** is adjusted accordingly.                                                  **
 **                                                                           **
 ** .control-name:focused {                                                   **
 **     -fx-background-color: -fx-focus-color, b, c, d                        **
 **     -fx-background-insets: -1.4, f, g, h                                  **
 **     -fx-background-radius: 6.4, j, k, l                                   **
 **  }                                                                        **

 ** In the "hover" pseudoclass, the -fx-color is replaced with -fx-hover-base **
 ** which will result in a re-derivation of the other colors in               **
 ** -fx-background-colors:                                                    **
 **                                                                           **

 ** In the "armed" pseudoclass, the -fx-color is replaced with                **
 ** -fx-pressed-base, which will result in a rederivation of the other colors **
 ** in -fx-background-colors:                                                 **
 **                                                                           **
 ** .control-name:armed {                                                     **
 **     -fx-color: -fx-pressed-base;                                          **

 ** The control will also typically include a  "disabled" pseudoclass which   **
 ** makes the component transparent:                                          **
 **                                                                           **
