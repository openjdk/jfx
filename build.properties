# NOTE: It is no longer necessary to modify this file to switch the
# milestone to fcs.
#
# By default the milestone is set to early access (ea) for all builds. It
# is overridden by the RE build script, which passes "-PMILESTONE_FCS=true"
# to gradle when the BUILD_MILESTONE env variable is set to "fcs". This
# will cause the suffix to become blank.
jfx.release.suffix=-ea

# Set this property to the name of the experimental feature for your branch in sandbox.
# Do not include a dash in the name. For example, if you have a sandbox branch
# named myfeature you might set jfx.experimental.feature.name=myfeature
jfx.experimental.feature.name=

# UPDATE THE FOLLOWING VALUES FOR A NEW RELEASE
jfx.release.major.version=25
jfx.release.minor.version=0
jfx.release.security.version=0
jfx.release.patch.version=0

# Note: The release version is now calculated in build.gradle as the
# dot-separated concatenation of the previous four fields with trailing zero
# fields removed

# Build properties for defining the version of JDK used to build FX
#
# jfx.build.jdk.buildnum should be set to the JDK build number used to
# compile FX. This variable is read by the Hudson build scripts to
# select the JDK.
#
# jdk.docs.version should be set to the JDK feature version used for
# javadoc links to JDK classes from JavaFX classes. It is typically the
# feature version corresponding to the JDK used to compile JavaFX.
#
# jfx.build.jdk.buildnum.min should be set to the lowest version that
# supports building FX (which must be <= jfx.build.jdk.buildnum)
#
# jfx.jdk.target.version is set to the minimum runtime version that
# JavaFX will run on. This is passed to javac as the value of "--release",
# so it also defines the language features that can be used.
