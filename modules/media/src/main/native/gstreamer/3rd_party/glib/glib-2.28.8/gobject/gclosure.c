/**
 * SECTION:gclosure
 * @short_description: Functions as first-class objects
 * @title: Closures
 *
 * A #GClosure represents a callback supplied by the programmer. It
 * will generally comprise a function of some kind and a marshaller
 * used to call it. It is the reponsibility of the marshaller to
 * convert the arguments for the invocation from #GValue<!-- -->s into
 * a suitable form, perform the callback on the converted arguments,
 * and transform the return value back into a #GValue.
 *
 * In the case of C programs, a closure usually just holds a pointer
 * to a function and maybe a data argument, and the marshaller
 * converts between #GValue<!-- --> and native C types. The GObject
 * library provides the #GCClosure type for this purpose. Bindings for
 * other languages need marshallers which convert between #GValue<!--
 * -->s and suitable representations in the runtime of the language in
 * order to use functions written in that languages as callbacks.
 *
 * Within GObject, closures play an important role in the
 * implementation of signals. When a signal is registered, the
 * @c_marshaller argument to g_signal_new() specifies the default C
 * marshaller for any closure which is connected to this
 * signal. GObject provides a number of C marshallers for this
 * purpose, see the g_cclosure_marshal_*() functions. Additional C
 * marshallers can be generated with the <link
 * linkend="glib-genmarshal">glib-genmarshal</link> utility.  Closures
 * can be explicitly connected to signals with
 * g_signal_connect_closure(), but it usually more convenient to let
 * GObject create a closure automatically by using one of the
 * g_signal_connect_*() functions which take a callback function/user
 * data pair.
 *
 * Using closures has a number of important advantages over a simple
 * callback function/data pointer combination:
 * <itemizedlist>
 * <listitem><para>
 * Closures allow the callee to get the types of the callback parameters,
 * which means that language bindings don't have to write individual glue
 * for each callback type.
 * </para></listitem>
 * <listitem><para>
 * The reference counting of #GClosure makes it easy to handle reentrancy
 * right; if a callback is removed while it is being invoked, the closure
 * and its parameters won't be freed until the invocation finishes.
 * </para></listitem>
 * <listitem><para>
 * g_closure_invalidate() and invalidation notifiers allow callbacks to be
 * automatically removed when the objects they point to go away.
 * </para></listitem>
 * </itemizedlist>

 * Takes over the initial ownership of a closure.  Each closure is
 * initially created in a <firstterm>floating</firstterm> state, which
 * means that the initial reference count is not owned by any caller.
 * g_closure_sink() checks to see if the object is still floating, and
 * if so, unsets the floating state and decreases the reference
 * count. If the closure is not floating, g_closure_sink() does
 * nothing. The reason for the existance of the floating state is to
 * prevent cumbersome code sequences like:
 * |[
 * closure = g_cclosure_new (cb_func, cb_data);
 * g_source_set_closure (source, closure);
 * g_closure_unref (closure); // XXX GObject doesn't really need this
 * ]|
 * Because g_source_set_closure() (and similar functions) take ownership of the
 * initial reference count, if it is unowned, we instead can write:
 * |[
 * g_source_set_closure (source, g_cclosure_new (cb_func, cb_data));
 * ]|
 *
 * Generally, this function is used together with g_closure_ref(). Ane example
 * of storing a closure for later notification looks like:
 * |[
 * static GClosure *notify_closure = NULL;
 * void
 * foo_notify_set_closure (GClosure *closure)
 * {
 *   if (notify_closure)
 *     g_closure_unref (notify_closure);

 *       g_closure_ref (notify_closure);
 *       g_closure_sink (notify_closure);
 *     }
 * }
 * ]|
 *
 * Because g_closure_sink() may decrement the reference count of a closure
 * (if it hasn't been called on @closure yet) just like g_closure_unref(),
 * g_closure_ref() should be called prior to this function.
