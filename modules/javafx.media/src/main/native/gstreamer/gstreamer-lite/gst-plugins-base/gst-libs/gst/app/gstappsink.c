 * SECTION:gstappsink
 * @title: GstAppSink
 * @short_description: Easy way for applications to extract samples from a
 *     pipeline
 * @see_also: #GstSample, #GstBaseSink, appsrc
 *
 * Appsink is a sink plugin that supports many different methods for making
 * the application get a handle on the GStreamer data in a pipeline. Unlike
 * most GStreamer elements, Appsink provides external API functions.
 *
 * appsink can be used by linking to the gstappsink.h header file to access the
 * methods or by using the appsink action signals and properties.
 *
 * The normal way of retrieving samples from appsink is by using the
 * gst_app_sink_pull_sample() and gst_app_sink_pull_preroll() methods.
 * These methods block until a sample becomes available in the sink or when the
 * sink is shut down or reaches EOS. There are also timed variants of these
 * methods, gst_app_sink_try_pull_sample() and gst_app_sink_try_pull_preroll(),
 * which accept a timeout parameter to limit the amount of time to wait.
 *
 * Appsink will internally use a queue to collect buffers from the streaming
 * thread. If the application is not pulling samples fast enough, this queue
 * will consume a lot of memory over time. The "max-buffers" property can be
 * used to limit the queue size. The "drop" property controls whether the
 * streaming thread blocks or if older buffers are dropped when the maximum
 * queue size is reached. Note that blocking the streaming thread can negatively
 * affect real-time performance and should be avoided.
 *
 * If a blocking behaviour is not desirable, setting the "emit-signals" property
 * to %TRUE will make appsink emit the "new-sample" and "new-preroll" signals
 * when a sample can be pulled without blocking.
 *
 * The "caps" property on appsink can be used to control the formats that
 * appsink can receive. This property can contain non-fixed caps, the format of
 * the pulled samples can be obtained by getting the sample caps.
 *
 * If one of the pull-preroll or pull-sample methods return %NULL, the appsink
 * is stopped or in the EOS state. You can check for the EOS state with the
 * "eos" property or with the gst_app_sink_is_eos() method.
 *
 * The eos signal can also be used to be informed when the EOS state is reached
 * to avoid polling.
