/**
 * SECTION:gstappsrc
 * @title: GstAppSrc
 * @short_description: Easy way for applications to inject buffers into a
 *     pipeline
 * @see_also: #GstBaseSrc, appsink
 *
 * The appsrc element can be used by applications to insert data into a
 * GStreamer pipeline. Unlike most GStreamer elements, appsrc provides
 * external API functions.
 *
 * appsrc can be used by linking with the libgstapp library to access the
 * methods directly or by using the appsrc action signals.
 *
 * Before operating appsrc, the caps property must be set to fixed caps
 * describing the format of the data that will be pushed with appsrc. An
 * exception to this is when pushing buffers with unknown caps, in which case no
 * caps should be set. This is typically true of file-like sources that push raw
 * byte buffers. If you don't want to explicitly set the caps, you can use
 * gst_app_src_push_sample. This method gets the caps associated with the
 * sample and sets them on the appsrc replacing any previously set caps (if
 * different from sample's caps).
 *
 * The main way of handing data to the appsrc element is by calling the
 * gst_app_src_push_buffer() method or by emitting the push-buffer action signal.
 * This will put the buffer onto a queue from which appsrc will read from in its
 * streaming thread. It is important to note that data transport will not happen
 * from the thread that performed the push-buffer call.
 *
 * The "max-bytes" property controls how much data can be queued in appsrc
 * before appsrc considers the queue full. A filled internal queue will always
 * signal the "enough-data" signal, which signals the application that it should
 * stop pushing data into appsrc. The "block" property will cause appsrc to
 * block the push-buffer method until free data becomes available again.
 *
 * When the internal queue is running out of data, the "need-data" signal is
 * emitted, which signals the application that it should start pushing more data
 * into appsrc.
 *
 * In addition to the "need-data" and "enough-data" signals, appsrc can emit the
 * "seek-data" signal when the "stream-mode" property is set to "seekable" or
 * "random-access". The signal argument will contain the new desired position in
 * the stream expressed in the unit set with the "format" property. After
 * receiving the seek-data signal, the application should push-buffers from the
 * new position.
 *
 * These signals allow the application to operate the appsrc in two different
 * ways:
 *
 * The push mode, in which the application repeatedly calls the push-buffer/push-sample
 * method with a new buffer/sample. Optionally, the queue size in the appsrc
 * can be controlled with the enough-data and need-data signals by respectively
 * stopping/starting the push-buffer/push-sample calls. This is a typical
 * mode of operation for the stream-type "stream" and "seekable". Use this
 * mode when implementing various network protocols or hardware devices.
 *
 * The pull mode, in which the need-data signal triggers the next push-buffer call.
 * This mode is typically used in the "random-access" stream-type. Use this
 * mode for file access or other randomly accessible sources. In this mode, a
 * buffer of exactly the amount of bytes given by the need-data signal should be
 * pushed into appsrc.
 *
 * In all modes, the size property on appsrc should contain the total stream
 * size in bytes. Setting this property is mandatory in the random-access mode.
 * For the stream and seekable modes, setting this property is optional but
 * recommended.
 *
 * When the application has finished pushing data into appsrc, it should call
 * gst_app_src_end_of_stream() or emit the end-of-stream action signal. After
 * this call, no more buffers can be pushed into appsrc until a flushing seek
 * occurs or the state of the appsrc has gone through READY.
