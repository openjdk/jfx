 * gst_audio_buffer_map:
 * @buffer: pointer to a #GstAudioBuffer
 * @info: the audio properties of the buffer
 * @gstbuffer: (transfer none): the #GstBuffer to be mapped
 * @flags: the access mode for the memory
 *
 * Maps an audio @gstbuffer so that it can be read or written and stores the
 * result of the map operation in @buffer.
 *
 * This is especially useful when the @gstbuffer is in non-interleaved (planar)
 * layout, in which case this function will use the information in the
 * @gstbuffer's attached #GstAudioMeta in order to map each channel in a
 * separate "plane" in #GstAudioBuffer. If a #GstAudioMeta is not attached
 * on the @gstbuffer, then it must be in interleaved layout.
 *
 * If a #GstAudioMeta is attached, then the #GstAudioInfo on the meta is checked
 * against @info. Normally, they should be equal, but in case they are not,
 * a g_critical will be printed and the #GstAudioInfo from the meta will be
 * used.
 *
 * In non-interleaved buffers, it is possible to have each channel on a separate
 * #GstMemory. In this case, each memory will be mapped separately to avoid
 * copying their contents in a larger memory area. Do note though that it is
 * not supported to have a single channel spanning over two or more different
 * #GstMemory objects. Although the map operation will likely succeed in this
 * case, it will be highly sub-optimal and it is recommended to merge all the
 * memories in the buffer before calling this function.
 *
 * Note: The actual #GstBuffer is not ref'ed, but it is required to stay valid
 * as long as it's mapped.
 *
 * Returns: %TRUE if the map operation succeeded or %FALSE on failure
 *
 * Since: 1.16
