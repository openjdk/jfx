/**
 * SECTION:gstpbutils
 * @title: Pbutils
 * @short_description: General Application and Plugin Utility Library
 *
 * libgstpbutils is a general utility library for plugins and applications.
 * It currently provides the
 * following:
 *
 * * human-readable description strings of codecs, elements, sources, decoders,
 * encoders, or sinks from decoder/encoder caps, element names, or protocol
 * names.
 *
 * * support for applications to initiate installation of missing plugins (if
 * this is supported by the distribution or operating system used)
 *
 * * API for GStreamer elements to create missing-plugin messages in order to
 * communicate to the application that a certain type of plugin is missing
 * (decoder, encoder, URI protocol source, URI protocol sink, named element)
 *
 * * API for applications to recognise and handle missing-plugin messages
 *
 * ## Linking to this library
 *
 * You should obtain the required CFLAGS and LIBS using pkg-config on the
 * gstreamer-plugins-base-1.0 module. You will then also need to add
 * '-lgstreamer-pbutils-1.0' manually to your LIBS line.
 *
 * ## Library initialisation
 *
 * Before using any of its functions, applications and plugins must call
 * gst_pb_utils_init() to initialise the library.
 *
