/**
 * gst_type_find_helper_for_buffer_with_extension:
 * @obj: (allow-none): object doing the typefinding, or %NULL (used for logging)
 * @buf: (in) (transfer none): a #GstBuffer with data to typefind
 * @extension: (allow-none): extension of the media, or %NULL
 * @prob: (out) (allow-none): location to store the probability of the found
 *     caps, or %NULL
 *
 * Tries to find what type of data is contained in the given #GstBuffer, the
 * assumption being that the buffer represents the beginning of the stream or
 * file.
 *
 * All available typefinders will be called on the data in order of rank. If
 * a typefinding function returns a probability of %GST_TYPE_FIND_MAXIMUM,
 * typefinding is stopped immediately and the found caps will be returned
 * right away. Otherwise, all available typefind functions will the tried,
 * and the caps with the highest probability will be returned, or %NULL if
 * the content of the buffer could not be identified.
 *
 * When @extension is not %NULL, this function will first try the typefind
 * functions for the given extension, which might speed up the typefinding
 * in many cases.
 *
 * Free-function: gst_caps_unref
 *
 * Returns: (transfer full) (nullable): the #GstCaps corresponding to the data,
 *     or %NULL if no type could be found. The caller should free the caps
 *     returned with gst_caps_unref().
 *
 * Since: 1.16
