/**
 * SECTION:gsttocsetter
 * @title: GstTocSetter
 * @short_description: Element interface that allows setting and retrieval
 *                     of the TOC
 *
 * Element interface that allows setting of the TOC.
 *
 * Elements that support some kind of chapters or editions (or tracks like in
 * the FLAC cue sheet) will implement this interface.
 *
 * If you just want to retrieve the TOC in your application then all you
 * need to do is watch for TOC messages on your pipeline's bus (or you can
 * perform TOC query). This interface is only for setting TOC data, not for
 * extracting it. To set TOC from the application, find proper tocsetter element
 * and set TOC using gst_toc_setter_set_toc().
 *
 * Elements implementing the #GstTocSetter interface can extend existing TOC
 * by getting extend UID for that (you can use gst_toc_find_entry() to retrieve it)
 * with any TOC entries received from downstream.
