 * @GST_SEEK_FLAG_KEY_UNIT: seek to the nearest keyframe. This might be
 *                     faster but less accurate.
 * @GST_SEEK_FLAG_SEGMENT: perform a segment seek.
 * @GST_SEEK_FLAG_TRICKMODE: when doing fast forward or fast reverse playback, allow
 *                     elements to skip frames instead of generating all
 *                     frames. (Since: 1.6)
 * @GST_SEEK_FLAG_SNAP_BEFORE: go to a location before the requested position,
 *                     if %GST_SEEK_FLAG_KEY_UNIT this means the keyframe at or before
 *                     the requested position the one at or before the seek target.
 * @GST_SEEK_FLAG_SNAP_AFTER: go to a location after the requested position,

 *                     requested position.
 * @GST_SEEK_FLAG_SNAP_NEAREST: go to a position near the requested position,
 *                     if %GST_SEEK_FLAG_KEY_UNIT this means the keyframe closest
 *                     to the requested position, if both keyframes are at an equal
 *                     distance, behaves like %GST_SEEK_FLAG_SNAP_BEFORE.
 * @GST_SEEK_FLAG_TRICKMODE_KEY_UNITS: when doing fast forward or fast reverse
 *                     playback, request that elements only decode keyframes
 *                     and skip all other content, for formats that have
 *                     keyframes. (Since: 1.6)
 * @GST_SEEK_FLAG_TRICKMODE_FORWARD_PREDICTED: When doing fast forward or fast reverse
 *                     playback, request that elements only decode keyframes and
 *                     forward predicted frames and skip all other content (for example
 *                     B-Frames), for formats that have keyframes and forward predicted
 *                     frames. (Since: 1.18)
 * @GST_SEEK_FLAG_TRICKMODE_NO_AUDIO: when doing fast forward or fast reverse
 *                     playback, request that audio decoder elements skip
 *                     decoding and output only gap events or silence. (Since: 1.6)
 * @GST_SEEK_FLAG_INSTANT_RATE_CHANGE: Signals that a rate change should be
 *                     applied immediately. Only valid if start/stop position
 *                     are GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE, the playback direction does not change
 *                     and the seek is not flushing. (Since: 1.18)
 * @GST_SEEK_FLAG_SKIP: Deprecated backward compatibility flag, replaced
 *                     by %GST_SEEK_FLAG_TRICKMODE
 *
 * Flags to be used with gst_element_seek() or gst_event_new_seek(). All flags
 * can be used together.
 *
 * A non flushing seek might take some time to perform as the currently
 * playing data in the pipeline will not be cleared.
 *
 * An accurate seek might be slower for formats that don't have any indexes
 * or timestamp markers in the stream. Specifying this flag might require a
 * complete scan of the file in those cases.
 *
 * When performing a segment seek: after the playback of the segment completes,
 * no EOS will be emitted by the element that performed the seek, but a
 * %GST_MESSAGE_SEGMENT_DONE message will be posted on the bus by the element.
 * When this message is posted, it is possible to send a new seek event to
 * continue playback. With this seek method it is possible to perform seamless
 * looping or simple linear editing.
 *
 * When only changing the playback rate and not the direction, the
 * %GST_SEEK_FLAG_INSTANT_RATE_CHANGE flag can be used for a non-flushing seek
 * to signal that the rate change should be applied immediately. This requires
 * special support in the seek handlers (e.g. demuxers) and any elements
 * synchronizing to the clock, and in general can't work in all cases (for example
 * UDP streaming where the delivery rate is controlled by a remote server). The
 * instant-rate-change mode supports changing the trickmode-related GST_SEEK_ flags,
 * but can't be used in conjunction with other seek flags that affect the new
 * playback position - as the playback position will not be changing.
 *
 * When doing fast forward (rate > 1.0) or fast reverse (rate < -1.0) trickmode
 * playback, the %GST_SEEK_FLAG_TRICKMODE flag can be used to instruct decoders
 * and demuxers to adjust the playback rate by skipping frames. This can improve
 * performance and decrease CPU usage because not all frames need to be decoded.
 *
 * Beyond that, the %GST_SEEK_FLAG_TRICKMODE_KEY_UNITS flag can be used to
 * request that decoders skip all frames except key units, and
 * %GST_SEEK_FLAG_TRICKMODE_NO_AUDIO flags can be used to request that audio
 * decoders do no decoding at all, and simple output silence.
 *
 * The %GST_SEEK_FLAG_SNAP_BEFORE flag can be used to snap to the previous
 * relevant location, and the %GST_SEEK_FLAG_SNAP_AFTER flag can be used to
 * select the next relevant location. If %GST_SEEK_FLAG_KEY_UNIT is specified,
 * the relevant location is a keyframe. If both flags are specified, the nearest
 * of these locations will be selected. If none are specified, the implementation is
 * free to select whichever it wants.
 *
 * The before and after here are in running time, so when playing backwards,
 * the next location refers to the one that will played in next, and not the
 * one that is located after in the actual source stream.
 *
 * Also see part-seeking.txt in the GStreamer design documentation for more
 * details on the meaning of these flags and the behaviour expected of
 * elements that handle them.

/**
 * GstSegment:
 * @flags:        flags for this segment
 * @rate:         the playback rate of the segment is set in response to a seek
 *                event and, without any seek, the value should be '1.0'. This
 *                value is used by elements that synchronize buffer [running
 *                times](additional/design/synchronisation.md#running-time) on
 *                the clock (usually the sink elements), leading to consuming
 *                buffers faster (for a value '> 1.0') or slower (for '0.0 <
 *                value < 1.0') than normal playback speed. The rate also
 *                defines the playback direction, meaning that when the value is
 *                lower than '0.0', the playback happens in reverse, and the
 *                [stream-time](additional/design/synchronisation.md#stream-time)
 *                is going backward. The 'rate' value should never be '0.0'.
 * @applied_rate: The applied rate is the rate that has been applied to the stream.
 *                The effective/resulting playback rate of a stream is
 *                'rate * applied_rate'.
 *                The applied rate can be set by source elements when a server is
 *                sending the stream with an already modified playback speed
 *                rate. Filter elements that modify the stream in a way that
 *                modifies the playback speed should also modify the applied
 *                rate. For example the #videorate element when its
 *                #videorate:rate property is set will set the applied rate of
 *                the segment it pushed downstream. Also #scaletempo applies the
 *                input segment rate to the stream and outputs a segment with
 *                rate=1.0 and applied_rate=<inputsegment.rate>.
 * @format:       the unit used for all of the segment's values.
 * @base:         the running time (plus elapsed time, see offset) of the
 *                segment [start](GstSegment.start) ([stop](GstSegment.stop) if
 *                rate < 0.0).
 * @offset:       the offset expresses the elapsed time (in buffer timestamps)
 *                before a seek with its start (stop if rate < 0.0) seek type
 *                set to #GST_SEEK_TYPE_NONE, the value is set to the position
 *                of the segment at the time of the seek.
 * @start:        the start time of the segment (in buffer timestamps)
 *                [(PTS)](GstBuffer.pts), that is the timestamp of the first
 *                buffer to output inside the segment (last one during
 *                reverse playback). For example decoders will
 *                [clip](gst_segment_clip) out the buffers before the start
 *                time.
 * @stop:         the stop time of the segment (in buffer timestamps)
 *                [(PTS)](GstBuffer.pts), that is the timestamp of the last
 *                buffer to output inside the segment (first one during
 *                reverse playback). For example decoders will
 *                [clip](gst_segment_clip) out buffers after the stop time.
 * @time:         the stream time of the segment [start](GstSegment.start)
 *                ([stop](GstSegment.stop) if rate < 0.0).
 * @position:     the buffer timestamp position in the segment is supposed to be
 *                updated by elements such as sources, demuxers or parsers to
 *                track progress by setting it to the last pushed buffer' end time
 *                ([timestamp](GstBuffer.pts) + #GstBuffer.duration) for that
 *                specific segment. The position is used when reconfiguring the
 *                segment with #gst_segment_do_seek when the seek is only
 *                updating the segment (see [offset](GstSegment.offset)).
 * @duration:     the duration of the segment is the maximum absolute difference
 *                between #GstSegment.start and #GstSegment.stop if stop is not
 *                set, otherwise it should be the difference between those
 *                two values. This should be set by elements that know the
 *                overall stream duration (like demuxers) and will be used when
 *                seeking with #GST_SEEK_TYPE_END.
 *
 * The structure that holds the configured region of interest in a media file.
