 * @short_description: shell-like commandline handling
 *
 * GLib provides the functions g_shell_quote() and g_shell_unquote()
 * to handle shell-like quoting in strings. The function g_shell_parse_argv()
 * parses a string similar to the way a POSIX shell (/bin/sh) would.
 *
 * Note that string handling in shells has many obscure and historical
 * corner-cases which these functions do not necessarily reproduce. They
 * are good enough in practice, though.

/* g_parse_argv() does a semi-arbitrary weird subset of the way
 * the shell parses a command line. We don't do variable expansion,
 * don't understand that operators are tokens, don't do tilde expansion,
 * don't do command substitution, no arithmetic expansion, IFS gets ignored,
 * don't do filename globs, don't remove redirection stuff, etc.
 *
 * READ THE UNIX98 SPEC on "Shell Command Language" before changing
 * the behavior of this code.
 *
 * Steps to parsing the argv string:
 *
 *  - tokenize the string (but since we ignore operators,
 *    our tokenization may diverge from what the shell would do)
 *    note that tokenization ignores the internals of a quoted
 *    word and it always splits on spaces, not on IFS even
 *    if we used IFS. We also ignore "end of input indicator"
 *    (I guess this is control-D?)
 *
 *    Tokenization steps, from UNIX98 with operator stuff removed,
 *    are:
 *
 *    1) "If the current character is backslash, single-quote or
 *        double-quote (\, ' or ") and it is not quoted, it will affect
 *        quoting for subsequent characters up to the end of the quoted
 *        text. The rules for quoting are as described in Quoting
 *        . During token recognition no substitutions will be actually
 *        performed, and the result token will contain exactly the
 *        characters that appear in the input (except for newline
 *        character joining), unmodified, including any embedded or
 *        enclosing quotes or substitution operators, between the quote
 *        mark and the end of the quoted text. The token will not be
 *        delimited by the end of the quoted field."
 *
 *    2) "If the current character is an unquoted newline character,
 *        the current token will be delimited."
 *
 *    3) "If the current character is an unquoted blank character, any
 *        token containing the previous character is delimited and the
 *        current character will be discarded."
 *
 *    4) "If the previous character was part of a word, the current
 *        character will be appended to that word."
 *
 *    5) "If the current character is a "#", it and all subsequent
 *        characters up to, but excluding, the next newline character
 *        will be discarded as a comment. The newline character that
 *        ends the line is not considered part of the comment. The
 *        "#" starts a comment only when it is at the beginning of a
 *        token. Since the search for the end-of-comment does not
 *        consider an escaped newline character specially, a comment
 *        cannot be continued to the next line."
 *
 *    6) "The current character will be used as the start of a new word."
 *
 *
 *  - for each token (word), perform portions of word expansion, namely
 *    field splitting (using default whitespace IFS) and quote
 *    removal.  Field splitting may increase the number of words.
 *    Quote removal does not increase the number of words.
 *
 *   "If the complete expansion appropriate for a word results in an
 *   empty field, that empty field will be deleted from the list of
 *   fields that form the completely expanded command, unless the
 *   original word contained single-quote or double-quote characters."
 *    - UNIX98 spec

/**
 * g_shell_parse_argv:
 * @command_line: (type filename): command line to parse
 * @argcp: (out) (optional): return location for number of args
 * @argvp: (out) (optional) (array length=argcp zero-terminated=1) (element-type filename):
 *   return location for array of args
 * @error: (optional): return location for error
 *
 * Parses a command line into an argument vector, in much the same way
 * the shell would, but without many of the expansions the shell would
 * perform (variable expansion, globs, operators, filename expansion,
 * etc. are not supported). The results are defined to be the same as
 * those you would get from a UNIX98 /bin/sh, as long as the input
 * contains none of the unsupported shell expansions. If the input
 * does contain such expansions, they are passed through
 * literally. Possible errors are those from the #G_SHELL_ERROR
 * domain. Free the returned vector with g_strfreev().
 *
 * Returns: %TRUE on success, %FALSE if error set
