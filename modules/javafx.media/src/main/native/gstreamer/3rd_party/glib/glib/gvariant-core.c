/* struct GVariant:
 *
 * There are two primary forms of GVariant instances: "serialised form"
 * and "tree form".
 *
 * "serialised form": A serialised GVariant instance stores its value in
 *                    the GVariant serialisation format.  All
 *                    basic-typed instances (ie: non-containers) are in
 *                    serialised format, as are some containers.
 *
 * "tree form": Some containers are in "tree form".  In this case,
 *              instead of containing the serialised data for the
 *              container, the instance contains an array of pointers to
 *              the child values of the container (thus forming a tree).
 *
 * It is possible for an instance to transition from tree form to
 * serialised form.  This happens, implicitly, if the serialised data is
 * requested (eg: via g_variant_get_data()).  Serialised form instances
 * never transition into tree form.
 *
 *
 * The fields of the structure are documented here:
 *
 * type_info: this is a reference to a GVariantTypeInfo describing the
 *            type of the instance.  When the instance is freed, this
 *            reference must be released with g_variant_type_info_unref().
 *
 *            The type_info field never changes during the life of the
 *            instance, so it can be accessed without a lock.
 *
 * size: this is the size of the serialised form for the instance, if it
 *       is known.  If the instance is in serialised form then it is, by
 *       definition, known.  If the instance is in tree form then it may
 *       be unknown (in which case it is -1).  It is possible for the
 *       size to be known when in tree form if, for example, the user
 *       has called g_variant_get_size() without calling
 *       g_variant_get_data().  Additionally, even when the user calls
 *       g_variant_get_data() the size of the data must first be
 *       determined so that a large enough buffer can be allocated for
 *       the data.
 *
 *       Once the size is known, it can never become unknown again.
 *       g_variant_ensure_size() is used to ensure that the size is in
 *       the known state -- it calculates the size if needed.  After
 *       that, the size field can be accessed without a lock.
 *
 * contents: a union containing either the information associated with
 *           holding a value in serialised form or holding a value in
 *           tree form.
 *
 *   .serialised: Only valid when the instance is in serialised form.
 *
 *                Since an instance can never transition away from
 *                serialised form, once these fields are set, they will
 *                never be changed.  It is therefore valid to access
 *                them without holding a lock.
 *
 *     .bytes:  the #GBytes that contains the memory pointed to by
 *              .data, or %NULL if .data is %NULL.  In the event that
 *              the instance was deserialised from another instance,
 *              then the bytes will be shared by both of them.  When
 *              the instance is freed, this reference must be released
 *              with g_bytes_unref().
 *
 *     .data: the serialised data (of size 'size') of the instance.
 *            This pointer should not be freed or modified in any way.
 *            #GBytes is responsible for memory management.
 *
 *            This pointer may be %NULL in two cases:
 *
 *              - if the serialised size of the instance is 0
 *
 *              - if the instance is of a fixed-sized type and was
 *                deserialised out of a corrupted container such that
 *                the container contains too few bytes to point to the
 *                entire proper fixed-size of this instance.  In this
 *                case, 'size' will still be equal to the proper fixed
 *                size, but this pointer will be %NULL.  This is exactly
 *                the reason that g_variant_get_data() sometimes returns
 *                %NULL.  For all other calls, the effect should be as
 *                if .data pointed to the appropriate number of nul
 *                bytes.
 *
 *   .tree: Only valid when the instance is in tree form.
 *
 *          Note that accesses from other threads could result in
 *          conversion of the instance from tree form to serialised form
 *          at any time.  For this reason, the instance lock must always
 *          be held while performing any operations on 'contents.tree'.
 *
 *     .children: the array of the child instances of this instance.
 *                When the instance is freed (or converted to serialised
 *                form) then each child must have g_variant_unref()
 *                called on it and the array must be freed using
 *                g_free().
 *
 *     .n_children: the number of items in the .children array.
 *
 * state: a bitfield describing the state of the instance.  It is a
 *        bitwise-or of the following STATE_* constants:
 *
 *    STATE_LOCKED: the instance lock is held.  This is the bit used by
 *                  g_bit_lock().
 *
 *    STATE_SERIALISED: the instance is in serialised form.  If this
 *                      flag is not set then the instance is in tree
 *                      form.
 *
 *    STATE_TRUSTED: for serialised form instances, this means that the
 *                   serialised data is known to be in normal form (ie:
 *                   not corrupted).
 *
 *                   For tree form instances, this means that all of the
 *                   child instances in the contents.tree.children array
 *                   are trusted.  This means that if the container is
 *                   serialised then the resulting data will be in
 *                   normal form.
 *
 *                   If this flag is unset it does not imply that the
 *                   data is corrupted.  It merely means that we're not
 *                   sure that it's valid.  See g_variant_is_trusted().
 *
 *    STATE_FLOATING: if this flag is set then the object has a floating
 *                    reference.  See g_variant_ref_sink().
 *
 * ref_count: the reference count of the instance
 *
 * depth: the depth of the GVariant in a hierarchy of nested containers,
 *        increasing with the level of nesting. The top-most GVariant has depth
 *        zero.  This is used to avoid recursing too deeply and overflowing the
 *        stack when handling deeply nested untrusted serialised GVariants.

/* This begins the main body of the recursive serialiser.
 *
 * There are 3 functions here that work as a team with the serialiser to
 * get things done.  g_variant_store() has a trivial role, but as a
 * public API function, it has its definition elsewhere.
 *
 * Note that "serialisation" of an instance does not mean that the
 * instance is converted to serialised form -- it means that the
 * serialised form of an instance is written to an external buffer.
 * g_variant_ensure_serialised() (which is not part of this set of
 * functions) is the function that is responsible for converting an
 * instance to serialised form.
 *
 * We are only concerned here with container types since non-container
 * instances are always in serialised form.  For these instances,
 * storing their serialised form merely involves a memcpy().
 *
 * Serialisation is a two-step process.  First, the size of the
 * serialised data must be calculated so that an appropriately-sized
 * buffer can be allocated.  Second, the data is written into the
 * buffer.
 *
 * Determining the size:
 *   The process of determining the size is triggered by a call to
 *   g_variant_ensure_size() on a container.  This invokes the
 *   serialiser code to determine the size.  The serialiser is passed
 *   g_variant_fill_gvs() as a callback.
 *
 *   g_variant_fill_gvs() is called by the serialiser on each child of
 *   the container which, in turn, calls g_variant_ensure_size() on
 *   itself and fills in the result of its own size calculation.
 *
 *   The serialiser uses the size information from the children to
 *   calculate the size needed for the entire container.
 *
 * Writing the data:
 *   After the buffer has been allocated, g_variant_serialise() is
 *   called on the container.  This invokes the serialiser code to write
 *   the bytes to the container.  The serialiser is, again, passed
 *   g_variant_fill_gvs() as a callback.
 *
 *   This time, when g_variant_fill_gvs() is called for each child, the
 *   child is given a pointer to a sub-region of the allocated buffer
 *   where it should write its data.  This is done by calling
 *   g_variant_store().  In the event that the instance is in serialised
 *   form this means a memcpy() of the serialised data into the
 *   allocated buffer.  In the event that the instance is in tree form
 *   this means a recursive call back into g_variant_serialise().
 *
 *
 * The forward declaration here allows corecursion via callback:

 *
 * Typically you want to use g_variant_ref_sink() in order to
 * automatically do the correct thing with respect to floating or
 * non-floating references, but there is one specific scenario where
 * this function is helpful.
 *
 * The situation where this function is helpful is when creating an API
 * that allows the user to provide a callback function that returns a
 * #GVariant.  We certainly want to allow the user the flexibility to
 * return a non-floating reference from this callback (for the case
 * where the value that is being returned already exists).
 *
 * At the same time, the style of the #GVariant API makes it likely that
 * for newly-created #GVariant instances, the user can be saved some
 * typing if they are allowed to return a #GVariant with a floating
 * reference.
 *
 * Using this function on the return value of the user's callback allows
 * the user to do whichever is more convenient for them.  The caller
 * will alway receives exactly one full reference to the value: either
 * the one that was returned in the first place, or a floating reference
 * that has been converted to a full reference.
 *
 * This function has an odd interaction when combined with
 * g_variant_ref_sink() running at the same time in another thread on
 * the same #GVariant instance.  If g_variant_ref_sink() runs first then
 * the result will be that the floating reference is converted to a hard
 * reference.  If g_variant_take_ref() runs first then the result will
 * be that the floating reference is converted to a hard reference and
 * an additional reference on top of that one is added.  It is best to
 * avoid this situation.
