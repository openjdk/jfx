/**
 * SECTION:atomic_operations
 * @title: Atomic Operations
 * @short_description: basic atomic integer and pointer operations
 * @see_also: #GMutex
 *
 * The following is a collection of compiler macros to provide atomic
 * access to integer and pointer-sized values.
 *
 * The macros that have 'int' in the name will operate on pointers to
 * #gint and #guint.  The macros with 'pointer' in the name will operate
 * on pointers to any pointer-sized value, including #gsize.  There is
 * no support for 64bit operations on platforms with 32bit pointers
 * because it is not generally possible to perform these operations
 * atomically.
 *
 * The get, set and exchange operations for integers and pointers
 * nominally operate on #gint and #gpointer, respectively.  Of the
 * arithmetic operations, the 'add' operation operates on (and returns)
 * signed integer values (#gint and #gssize) and the 'and', 'or', and
 * 'xor' operations operate on (and return) unsigned integer values
 * (#guint and #gsize).
 *
 * All of the operations act as a full compiler and (where appropriate)
 * hardware memory barrier.  Acquire and release or producer and
 * consumer barrier semantics are not available through this API.
 *
 * It is very important that all accesses to a particular integer or
 * pointer be performed using only this API and that different sizes of
 * operation are not mixed or used on overlapping memory regions.  Never
 * read or assign directly from or to a value -- always use this API.
 *
 * For simple reference counting purposes you should use
 * g_atomic_int_inc() and g_atomic_int_dec_and_test().  Other uses that
 * fall outside of simple reference counting patterns are prone to
 * subtle bugs and occasionally undefined behaviour.  It is also worth
 * noting that since all of these operations require global
 * synchronisation of the entire machine, they can be quite slow.  In
 * the case of performing multiple atomic operations it can often be
 * faster to simply acquire a mutex lock around the critical area,
 * perform the operations normally and then release the lock.
 **/

/**
 * G_ATOMIC_LOCK_FREE:
 *
 * This macro is defined if the atomic operations of GLib are
 * implemented using real hardware atomic operations.  This means that
 * the GLib atomic API can be used between processes and safely mixed
 * with other (hardware) atomic APIs.
 *
 * If this macro is not defined, the atomic operations may be
 * emulated using a mutex.  In that case, the GLib atomic operations are
 * only atomic relative to themselves and within a single process.
 **/

/* NOTE CAREFULLY:
 *
 * This file is the lowest-level part of GLib.
 *
 * Other lowlevel parts of GLib (threads, slice allocator, g_malloc,
 * messages, etc) call into these functions and macros to get work done.
 *
 * As such, these functions can not call back into any part of GLib
 * without risking recursion.
