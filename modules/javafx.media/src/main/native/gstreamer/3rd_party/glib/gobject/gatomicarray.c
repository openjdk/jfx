/* A GAtomicArray is a growable, mutable array of data
 * generally of the form of a header of a specific size and
 * then an array of items of a fixed size.
 *
 * It is possible to do lock-less read transactions from the
 * array without any protection against other reads or writes,
 * but such read operation must be aware that the data in the
 * atomic array can change at any time during the transaction,
 * and only at the end can we verify if the transaction succeeded
 * or not. Thus the reading transaction cannot for instance
 * dereference a pointer in the array inside the transaction.
 *
 * The size of an array however cannot change during a read
 * transaction.
 *
 * Writes to the array is done in a copy-update style, but there
 * is no real protection against multiple writers overwriting each
 * others updates, so writes must be protected by an external lock.
