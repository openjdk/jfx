/**
 * SECTION:string_chunks
 * @title: String Chunks
 * @short_description: efficient storage of groups of strings
 *
 * String chunks are used to store groups of strings. Memory is
 * allocated in blocks, and as strings are added to the #GStringChunk
 * they are copied into the next free position in a block. When a block
 * is full a new block is allocated.
 *
 * When storing a large number of strings, string chunks are more
 * efficient than using g_strdup() since fewer calls to malloc() are
 * needed, and less memory is wasted in memory allocation overheads.
 *
 * By adding strings with g_string_chunk_insert_const() it is also
 * possible to remove duplicates.
 *
 * To create a new #GStringChunk use g_string_chunk_new().
 *
 * To add strings to a #GStringChunk use g_string_chunk_insert().
 *
 * To add strings to a #GStringChunk, but without duplicating strings
 * which are already in the #GStringChunk, use
 * g_string_chunk_insert_const().
 *
 * To free the entire #GStringChunk use g_string_chunk_free(). It is
 * not possible to free individual strings.
