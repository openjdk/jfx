/**
 * SECTION:memory
 * @Short_Description: general memory-handling
 * @Title: Memory Allocation
 *
 * These functions provide support for allocating and freeing memory.
 *
 * If any call to allocate memory using functions g_new(), g_new0(), g_renew(),
 * g_malloc(), g_malloc0(), g_malloc0_n(), g_realloc(), and g_realloc_n()
 * fails, the application is terminated. This also means that there is no
 * need to check if the call succeeded. On the other hand, the `g_try_...()` family
 * of functions returns %NULL on failure that can be used as a check
 * for unsuccessful memory allocation. The application is not terminated
 * in this case.
 *
 * As all GLib functions and data structures use `g_malloc()` internally, unless
 * otherwise specified, any allocation failure will result in the application
 * being terminated.
 *
 * It's important to match g_malloc() (and wrappers such as g_new()) with
 * g_free(), g_slice_alloc() (and wrappers such as g_slice_new()) with
 * g_slice_free(), plain malloc() with free(), and (if you're using C++)
 * new with delete and new[] with delete[]. Otherwise bad things can happen,
 * since these allocators may use different memory pools (and new/delete call
 * constructors and destructors).
 *
 * Since GLib 2.46 g_malloc() is hardcoded to always use the system malloc
 * implementation.
