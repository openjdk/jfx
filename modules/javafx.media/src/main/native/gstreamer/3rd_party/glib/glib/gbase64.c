/**
 * SECTION:base64
 * @title: Base64 Encoding
 * @short_description: encodes and decodes data in Base64 format
 *
 * Base64 is an encoding that allows a sequence of arbitrary bytes to be
 * encoded as a sequence of printable ASCII characters. For the definition
 * of Base64, see
 * [RFC 1421](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1421.txt)
 * or
 * [RFC 2045](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2045.txt).
 * Base64 is most commonly used as a MIME transfer encoding
 * for email.
 *
 * GLib supports incremental encoding using g_base64_encode_step() and
 * g_base64_encode_close(). Incremental decoding can be done with
 * g_base64_decode_step(). To encode or decode data in one go, use
 * g_base64_encode() or g_base64_decode(). To avoid memory allocation when
 * decoding, you can use g_base64_decode_inplace().
 *
 * Support for Base64 encoding has been added in GLib 2.12.

/**
 * g_base64_encode_step:
 * @in: (array length=len) (element-type guint8): the binary data to encode
 * @len: the length of @in
 * @break_lines: whether to break long lines
 * @out: (out) (array) (element-type guint8): pointer to destination buffer
 * @state: (inout): Saved state between steps, initialize to 0
 * @save: (inout): Saved state between steps, initialize to 0
 *
 * Incrementally encode a sequence of binary data into its Base-64 stringified
 * representation. By calling this function multiple times you can convert
 * data in chunks to avoid having to have the full encoded data in memory.
 *
 * When all of the data has been converted you must call
 * g_base64_encode_close() to flush the saved state.
 *
 * The output buffer must be large enough to fit all the data that will
 * be written to it. Due to the way base64 encodes you will need
 * at least: (@len / 3 + 1) * 4 + 4 bytes (+ 4 may be needed in case of
 * non-zero state). If you enable line-breaking you will need at least:
 * ((@len / 3 + 1) * 4 + 4) / 76 + 1 bytes of extra space.
 *
 * @break_lines is typically used when putting base64-encoded data in emails.
 * It breaks the lines at 76 columns instead of putting all of the text on
 * the same line. This avoids problems with long lines in the email system.
 * Note however that it breaks the lines with `LF` characters, not
 * `CR LF` sequences, so the result cannot be passed directly to SMTP
 * or certain other protocols.
 *
 * Returns: The number of bytes of output that was written
 *
 * Since: 2.12
