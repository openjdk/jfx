/**
 * SECTION:gtypeplugin
 * @short_description: An interface for dynamically loadable types
 * @see_also: #GTypeModule and g_type_register_dynamic().
 * @title: GTypePlugin
 *
 * The GObject type system supports dynamic loading of types.
 * The #GTypePlugin interface is used to handle the lifecycle
 * of dynamically loaded types. It goes as follows:
 *
 * 1. The type is initially introduced (usually upon loading the module
 *    the first time, or by your main application that knows what modules
 *    introduces what types), like this:
 *    |[<!-- language="C" -->
 *    new_type_id = g_type_register_dynamic (parent_type_id,
 *                                           "TypeName",
 *                                           new_type_plugin,
 *                                           type_flags);
 *    ]|
 *    where @new_type_plugin is an implementation of the
 *    #GTypePlugin interface.
 *
 * 2. The type's implementation is referenced, e.g. through
 *    g_type_class_ref() or through g_type_create_instance() (this is
 *    being called by g_object_new()) or through one of the above done on
 *    a type derived from @new_type_id.
 *
 * 3. This causes the type system to load the type's implementation by
 *    calling g_type_plugin_use() and g_type_plugin_complete_type_info()
 *    on @new_type_plugin.
 *
 * 4. At some point the type's implementation isn't required anymore,
 *    e.g. after g_type_class_unref() or g_type_free_instance() (called
 *    when the reference count of an instance drops to zero).
 *
 * 5. This causes the type system to throw away the information retrieved
 *    from g_type_plugin_complete_type_info() and then it calls
 *    g_type_plugin_unuse() on @new_type_plugin.
 *
 * 6. Things may repeat from the second step.
 *
 * So basically, you need to implement a #GTypePlugin type that
 * carries a use_count, once use_count goes from zero to one, you need
 * to load the implementation to successfully handle the upcoming
 * g_type_plugin_complete_type_info() call. Later, maybe after
 * succeeding use/unuse calls, once use_count drops to zero, you can
 * unload the implementation again. The type system makes sure to call
 * g_type_plugin_use() and g_type_plugin_complete_type_info() again
 * when the type is needed again.
 *
 * #GTypeModule is an implementation of #GTypePlugin that already
 * implements most of this except for the actual module loading and
 * unloading. It even handles multiple registered types per module.
