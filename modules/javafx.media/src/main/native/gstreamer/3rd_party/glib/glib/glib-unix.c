 * g_unix_open_pipe:
 * @fds: (array fixed-size=2): Array of two integers
 * @flags: Bitfield of file descriptor flags, as for fcntl()
 * @error: a #GError
 *
 * Similar to the UNIX pipe() call, but on modern systems like Linux
 * uses the pipe2() system call, which atomically creates a pipe with
 * the configured flags.
 *
 * As of GLib 2.78, the supported flags are `O_CLOEXEC`/`FD_CLOEXEC` (see below)
 * and `O_NONBLOCK`. Prior to GLib 2.78, only `FD_CLOEXEC` was supported â€” if
 * you wanted to configure `O_NONBLOCK` then that had to be done separately with
 * `fcntl()`.
 *
 * Since GLib 2.80, the constants %G_UNIX_PIPE_END_READ and
 * %G_UNIX_PIPE_END_WRITE can be used as mnemonic indexes in @fds.
 *
 * It is a programmer error to call this function with unsupported flags, and a
 * critical warning will be raised.
 *
 * As of GLib 2.78, it is preferred to pass `O_CLOEXEC` in, rather than
 * `FD_CLOEXEC`, as that matches the underlying `pipe()` API more closely. Prior
 * to 2.78, only `FD_CLOEXEC` was supported. Support for `FD_CLOEXEC` may be
 * deprecated and removed in future.
 *
 * Returns: %TRUE on success, %FALSE if not (and errno will be set).
 *
 * Since: 2.30
