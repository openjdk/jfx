/**
 * SECTION:threads
 * @title: Threads
 * @short_description: portable support for threads, mutexes, locks,
 *     conditions and thread private data
 * @see_also: #GThreadPool, #GAsyncQueue
 *
 * Threads act almost like processes, but unlike processes all threads
 * of one process share the same memory. This is good, as it provides
 * easy communication between the involved threads via this shared
 * memory, and it is bad, because strange things (so called
 * "Heisenbugs") might happen if the program is not carefully designed.
 * In particular, due to the concurrent nature of threads, no
 * assumptions on the order of execution of code running in different
 * threads can be made, unless order is explicitly forced by the
 * programmer through synchronization primitives.
 *
 * The aim of the thread-related functions in GLib is to provide a
 * portable means for writing multi-threaded software. There are
 * primitives for mutexes to protect the access to portions of memory
 * (#GMutex, #GRecMutex and #GRWLock). There is a facility to use
 * individual bits for locks (g_bit_lock()). There are primitives
 * for condition variables to allow synchronization of threads (#GCond).
 * There are primitives for thread-private data - data that every
 * thread has a private instance of (#GPrivate). There are facilities
 * for one-time initialization (#GOnce, g_once_init_enter()). Finally,
 * there are primitives to create and manage threads (#GThread).
 *
 * The GLib threading system used to be initialized with g_thread_init().
 * This is no longer necessary. Since version 2.32, the GLib threading
 * system is automatically initialized at the start of your program,
 * and all thread-creation functions and synchronization primitives
 * are available right away.
 *
 * Note that it is not safe to assume that your program has no threads
 * even if you don't call g_thread_new() yourself. GLib and GIO can
 * and will create threads for their own purposes in some cases, such
 * as when using g_unix_signal_source_new() or when using GDBus.
 *
 * Originally, UNIX did not have threads, and therefore some traditional
 * UNIX APIs are problematic in threaded programs. Some notable examples
 * are
 *
 * - C library functions that return data in statically allocated
 *   buffers, such as strtok() or strerror(). For many of these,
 *   there are thread-safe variants with a _r suffix, or you can
 *   look at corresponding GLib APIs (like g_strsplit() or g_strerror()).
 *
 * - The functions setenv() and unsetenv() manipulate the process
 *   environment in a not thread-safe way, and may interfere with getenv()
 *   calls in other threads. Note that getenv() calls may be hidden behind
 *   other APIs. For example, GNU gettext() calls getenv() under the
 *   covers. In general, it is best to treat the environment as readonly.
 *   If you absolutely have to modify the environment, do it early in
 *   main(), when no other threads are around yet.
 *
 * - The setlocale() function changes the locale for the entire process,
 *   affecting all threads. Temporary changes to the locale are often made
 *   to change the behavior of string scanning or formatting functions
 *   like scanf() or printf(). GLib offers a number of string APIs
 *   (like g_ascii_formatd() or g_ascii_strtod()) that can often be
 *   used as an alternative. Or you can use the uselocale() function
 *   to change the locale only for the current thread.
 *
 * - The fork() function only takes the calling thread into the child's
 *   copy of the process image. If other threads were executing in critical
 *   sections they could have left mutexes locked which could easily
 *   cause deadlocks in the new child. For this reason, you should
 *   call exit() or exec() as soon as possible in the child and only
 *   make signal-safe library calls before that.
 *
 * - The daemon() function uses fork() in a way contrary to what is
 *   described above. It should not be used with GLib programs.
 *
 * GLib itself is internally completely thread-safe (all global data is
 * automatically locked), but individual data structure instances are
 * not automatically locked for performance reasons. For example,
 * you must coordinate accesses to the same #GHashTable from multiple
 * threads. The two notable exceptions from this rule are #GMainLoop
 * and #GAsyncQueue, which are thread-safe and need no further
 * application-level locking to be accessed from multiple threads.
 * Most refcounting functions such as g_object_ref() are also thread-safe.
 *
 * A common use for #GThreads is to move a long-running blocking operation out
 * of the main thread and into a worker thread. For GLib functions, such as
 * single GIO operations, this is not necessary, and complicates the code.
 * Instead, the '..._async()' version of the function should be used from the main
 * thread, eliminating the need for locking and synchronisation between multiple
 * threads. If an operation does need to be moved to a worker thread, consider
 * using g_task_run_in_thread(), or a #GThreadPool. #GThreadPool is often a
 * better choice than #GThread, as it handles thread reuse and task queueing;
 * #GTask uses this internally.
 *
 * However, if multiple blocking operations need to be performed in sequence,
 * and it is not possible to use #GTask for them, moving them to a worker thread
 * can clarify the code.

/**

 * The #G_LOCK_ macros provide a convenient interface to #GMutex.
 * #G_LOCK_DEFINE defines a lock. It can appear in any place where
 * variable definitions may appear in programs, i.e. in the first block
 * of a function or outside of functions. The @name parameter will be
 * mangled to get the name of the #GMutex. This means that you
 * can use names of existing variables as the parameter - e.g. the name
 * of the variable you intend to protect with the lock. Look at our
 * give_me_next_number() example using the #G_LOCK macros:
 *
 * Here is an example for using the #G_LOCK convenience macros:

 *   G_LOCK_DEFINE (current_number);
 *
 *   int
 *   give_me_next_number (void)
 *   {

/* GMutex Documentation {{{1 ------------------------------------------ */

/**
 * GMutex:
 *
 * The #GMutex struct is an opaque data structure to represent a mutex
 * (mutual exclusion). It can be used to protect data against shared
 * access.
 *
 * Take for example the following function:
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 *   int
 *   give_me_next_number (void)
 *   {
 *     static int current_number = 0;
 *
 *     // now do a very complicated calculation to calculate the new
 *     // number, this might for example be a random number generator
 *     current_number = calc_next_number (current_number);
 *
 *     return current_number;
 *   }
 * ]|
 * It is easy to see that this won't work in a multi-threaded
 * application. There current_number must be protected against shared
 * access. A #GMutex can be used as a solution to this problem:
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 *   int
 *   give_me_next_number (void)
 *   {
 *     static GMutex mutex;
 *     static int current_number = 0;
 *     int ret_val;
 *
 *     g_mutex_lock (&mutex);
 *     ret_val = current_number = calc_next_number (current_number);
 *     g_mutex_unlock (&mutex);
 *
 *     return ret_val;
 *   }
 * ]|
 * Notice that the #GMutex is not initialised to any particular value.
 * Its placement in static storage ensures that it will be initialised
 * to all-zeros, which is appropriate.
 *
 * If a #GMutex is placed in other contexts (eg: embedded in a struct)
 * then it must be explicitly initialised using g_mutex_init().
 *
 * A #GMutex should only be accessed via g_mutex_ functions.
 */

/* GRecMutex Documentation {{{1 -------------------------------------- */

/**
 * GRecMutex:
 *
 * The GRecMutex struct is an opaque data structure to represent a
 * recursive mutex. It is similar to a #GMutex with the difference
 * that it is possible to lock a GRecMutex multiple times in the same
 * thread without deadlock. When doing so, care has to be taken to
 * unlock the recursive mutex as often as it has been locked.
 *
 * If a #GRecMutex is allocated in static storage then it can be used
 * without initialisation.  Otherwise, you should call
 * g_rec_mutex_init() on it and g_rec_mutex_clear() when done.
 *
 * A GRecMutex should only be accessed with the
 * g_rec_mutex_ functions.
 *
 * Since: 2.32
 */

/* GRWLock Documentation {{{1 ---------------------------------------- */

/**
 * GRWLock:
 *
 * The GRWLock struct is an opaque data structure to represent a
 * reader-writer lock. It is similar to a #GMutex in that it allows
 * multiple threads to coordinate access to a shared resource.
 *
 * The difference to a mutex is that a reader-writer lock discriminates
 * between read-only ('reader') and full ('writer') access. While only
 * one thread at a time is allowed write access (by holding the 'writer'
 * lock via g_rw_lock_writer_lock()), multiple threads can gain
 * simultaneous read-only access (by holding the 'reader' lock via
 * g_rw_lock_reader_lock()).
 *
 * It is unspecified whether readers or writers have priority in acquiring the
 * lock when a reader already holds the lock and a writer is queued to acquire
 * it.
 *
 * Here is an example for an array with access functions:
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 *   GRWLock lock;
 *   GPtrArray *array;
 *
 *   gpointer
 *   my_array_get (guint index)
 *   {
 *     gpointer retval = NULL;
 *
 *     if (!array)
 *       return NULL;
 *
 *     g_rw_lock_reader_lock (&lock);
 *     if (index < array->len)
 *       retval = g_ptr_array_index (array, index);
 *     g_rw_lock_reader_unlock (&lock);
 *
 *     return retval;
 *   }
 *
 *   void
 *   my_array_set (guint index, gpointer data)
 *   {
 *     g_rw_lock_writer_lock (&lock);
 *
 *     if (!array)
 *       array = g_ptr_array_new ();
 *
 *     if (index >= array->len)
 *       g_ptr_array_set_size (array, index+1);
 *     g_ptr_array_index (array, index) = data;
 *
 *     g_rw_lock_writer_unlock (&lock);
 *   }
 *  ]|
 * This example shows an array which can be accessed by many readers
 * (the my_array_get() function) simultaneously, whereas the writers
 * (the my_array_set() function) will only be allowed one at a time
 * and only if no readers currently access the array. This is because
 * of the potentially dangerous resizing of the array. Using these
 * functions is fully multi-thread safe now.
 *
 * If a #GRWLock is allocated in static storage then it can be used
 * without initialisation.  Otherwise, you should call
 * g_rw_lock_init() on it and g_rw_lock_clear() when done.
 *
 * A GRWLock should only be accessed with the g_rw_lock_ functions.

 * Since: 2.32

/* GCond Documentation {{{1 ------------------------------------------ */

/**
 * GCond:
 *
 * The #GCond struct is an opaque data structure that represents a
 * condition. Threads can block on a #GCond if they find a certain
 * condition to be false. If other threads change the state of this
 * condition they signal the #GCond, and that causes the waiting
 * threads to be woken up.
 *
 * Consider the following example of a shared variable.  One or more
 * threads can wait for data to be published to the variable and when
 * another thread publishes the data, it can signal one of the waiting
 * threads to wake up to collect the data.
 *
 * Here is an example for using GCond to block a thread until a condition
 * is satisfied:
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 *   gpointer current_data = NULL;
 *   GMutex data_mutex;
 *   GCond data_cond;
 *
 *   void
 *   push_data (gpointer data)
 *   {
 *     g_mutex_lock (&data_mutex);
 *     current_data = data;
 *     g_cond_signal (&data_cond);
 *     g_mutex_unlock (&data_mutex);
 *   }
 *
 *   gpointer
 *   pop_data (void)
 *   {
 *     gpointer data;
 *
 *     g_mutex_lock (&data_mutex);
 *     while (!current_data)
 *       g_cond_wait (&data_cond, &data_mutex);
 *     data = current_data;
 *     current_data = NULL;
 *     g_mutex_unlock (&data_mutex);
 *
 *     return data;
 *   }
 * ]|
 * Whenever a thread calls pop_data() now, it will wait until
 * current_data is non-%NULL, i.e. until some other thread
 * has called push_data().
 *
 * The example shows that use of a condition variable must always be
 * paired with a mutex.  Without the use of a mutex, there would be a
 * race between the check of @current_data by the while loop in
 * pop_data() and waiting. Specifically, another thread could set
 * @current_data after the check, and signal the cond (with nobody
 * waiting on it) before the first thread goes to sleep. #GCond is
 * specifically useful for its ability to release the mutex and go
 * to sleep atomically.
 *
 * It is also important to use the g_cond_wait() and g_cond_wait_until()
 * functions only inside a loop which checks for the condition to be
 * true.  See g_cond_wait() for an explanation of why the condition may
 * not be true even after it returns.
 *
 * If a #GCond is allocated in static storage then it can be used
 * without initialisation.  Otherwise, you should call g_cond_init()
 * on it and g_cond_clear() when done.
 *
 * A #GCond should only be accessed via the g_cond_ functions.

 * of @func becomes the return value of the thread, which can be obtained

 * The @name can be useful for discriminating threads in a debugger.

 *
 * If the thread can not be created the program aborts. See
 * g_thread_try_new() if you want to attempt to deal with failures.

 * If you are using threads to offload (potentially many) short-lived tasks,
