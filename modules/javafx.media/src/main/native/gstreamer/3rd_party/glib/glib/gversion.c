/**
 * SECTION:version
 * @Title: Version Information
 * @Short_description: variables and functions to check the GLib version
 *
 * GLib provides version information, primarily useful in configure
 * checks for builds that have a configure script. Applications will
 * not typically use the features described here.
 *
 * The GLib headers annotate deprecated APIs in a way that produces
 * compiler warnings if these deprecated APIs are used. The warnings
 * can be turned off by defining the macro %GLIB_DISABLE_DEPRECATION_WARNINGS
 * before including the glib.h header.
 *
 * GLib also provides support for building applications against
 * defined subsets of deprecated or new GLib APIs. Define the macro
 * %GLIB_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED to specify up to what version of GLib
 * you want to receive warnings about deprecated APIs. Define the
 * macro %GLIB_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED to specify the newest version of
 * GLib whose API you want to use.

 * @required_minor: the required minor version

 *
 * Checks that the GLib library in use is compatible with the
 * given version.
 *
 * Generally you would pass in the constants %GLIB_MAJOR_VERSION,
 * %GLIB_MINOR_VERSION, %GLIB_MICRO_VERSION as the three arguments
 * to this function; that produces a check that the library in use
 * is compatible with the version of GLib the application or module
 * was compiled against.
 *
 * Compatibility is defined by two things: first the version
 * of the running library is newer than the version
 * `@required_major.required_minor.@required_micro`. Second
 * the running library must be binary compatible with the
 * version `@required_major.@required_minor.@required_micro`
 * (same major version.)
 *
 * Returns: (transfer none) (nullable): %NULL if the GLib library is
 *   compatible with the given version, or a string describing the
 *   version mismatch. The returned string is owned by GLib and must
 *   not be modified or freed.
