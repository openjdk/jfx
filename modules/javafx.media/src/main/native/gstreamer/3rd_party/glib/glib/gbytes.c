/**
 * GBytes:
 *
 * A simple refcounted data type representing an immutable sequence of zero or
 * more bytes from an unspecified origin.
 *
 * The purpose of a #GBytes is to keep the memory region that it holds
 * alive for as long as anyone holds a reference to the bytes.  When
 * the last reference count is dropped, the memory is released. Multiple
 * unrelated callers can use byte data in the #GBytes without coordinating
 * their activities, resting assured that the byte data will not change or
 * move while they hold a reference.
 *
 * A #GBytes can come from many different origins that may have
 * different procedures for freeing the memory region.  Examples are
 * memory from g_malloc(), from memory slices, from a #GMappedFile or
 * memory from other allocators.
 *
 * #GBytes work well as keys in #GHashTable. Use g_bytes_equal() and
 * g_bytes_hash() as parameters to g_hash_table_new() or g_hash_table_new_full().
 * #GBytes can also be used as keys in a #GTree by passing the g_bytes_compare()
 * function to g_tree_new().
 *
 * The data pointed to by this bytes must not be modified. For a mutable
 * array of bytes see #GByteArray. Use g_bytes_unref_to_array() to create a
 * mutable array for a #GBytes sequence. To create an immutable #GBytes from
 * a mutable #GByteArray, use the g_byte_array_free_to_bytes() function.
 *
 * Since: 2.32
