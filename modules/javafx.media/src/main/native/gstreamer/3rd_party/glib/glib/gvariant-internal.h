/* The maximum number of levels of nested container which this implementation
 * of #GVariant will handle.
 *
 * The limit must be at least 64 + 1, to allow D-Bus messages to be wrapped in
 * a top-level #GVariant. This comes from the D-Bus specification ((Valid
 * Signatures)), but also seems generally reasonable. #GDBusMessage wraps its
 * payload in a top-level tuple.
 *
 * The limit is actually set to be a lot greater than 64, to allow much greater
 * nesting of values off D-Bus. It cannot be set over around 80000, or the risk
 * of overflowing the stack when parsing type strings becomes too great.
 *
 * Aside from those constraints, the choice of this value is arbitrary. The
 * only restrictions on it from the API are that it has to be greater than 64
 * (due to D-Bus).
