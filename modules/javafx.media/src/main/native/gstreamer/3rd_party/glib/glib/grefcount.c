/**
 * SECTION:refcount
 * @Title: Reference counting
 * @Short_description: Reference counting types and functions
 *
 * Reference counting is a garbage collection mechanism that is based on
 * assigning a counter to a data type, or any memory area; the counter is
 * increased whenever a new reference to that data type is acquired, and
 * decreased whenever the reference is released. Once the last reference
 * is released, the resources associated to that data type are freed.
 *
 * GLib uses reference counting in many of its data types, and provides
 * the #grefcount and #gatomicrefcount types to implement safe and atomic
 * reference counting semantics in new data types.
 *
 * It is important to note that #grefcount and #gatomicrefcount should be
 * considered completely opaque types; you should always use the provided
 * API to increase and decrease the counters, and you should never check
 * their content directly, or compare their content with other values.
 *
 * Since: 2.58
