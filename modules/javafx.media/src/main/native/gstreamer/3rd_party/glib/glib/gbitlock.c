 * This assumption holds because pointer bitlocks are restricted to
 * using the low order bits of the pointer as the lock.
 *
 * On 32 bits, there is nothing to do since the pointer size is equal to
 * the integer size.  On little endian the lower-order bits don't move,

 * pointer arithmetic: the low order bits are shifted by 4 bytes.  We
 * have a helper function that always does the right thing here.
 *
 * Since we always consider the low-order bits of the integer value, a
 * simple cast from (gsize) to (guint) always takes care of that.

 *
 *   g_futex_wait (g_futex_int_address (address), (guint) value);
