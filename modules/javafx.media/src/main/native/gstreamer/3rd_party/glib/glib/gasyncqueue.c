/**
 * SECTION:async_queues
 * @title: Asynchronous Queues
 * @short_description: asynchronous communication between threads
 * @see_also: #GThreadPool
 *
 * Often you need to communicate between different threads. In general
 * it's safer not to do this by shared memory, but by explicit message
 * passing. These messages only make sense asynchronously for
 * multi-threaded applications though, as a synchronous operation could
 * as well be done in the same thread.
 *
 * Asynchronous queues are an exception from most other GLib data
 * structures, as they can be used simultaneously from multiple threads
 * without explicit locking and they bring their own builtin reference
 * counting. This is because the nature of an asynchronous queue is that
 * it will always be used by at least 2 concurrent threads.
 *
 * For using an asynchronous queue you first have to create one with
 * g_async_queue_new(). #GAsyncQueue structs are reference counted,
 * use g_async_queue_ref() and g_async_queue_unref() to manage your
 * references.
 *
 * A thread which wants to send a message to that queue simply calls
 * g_async_queue_push() to push the message to the queue.
 *
 * A thread which is expecting messages from an asynchronous queue
 * simply calls g_async_queue_pop() for that queue. If no message is
 * available in the queue at that point, the thread is now put to sleep
 * until a message arrives. The message will be removed from the queue
 * and returned. The functions g_async_queue_try_pop() and
 * g_async_queue_timeout_pop() can be used to only check for the presence
 * of messages or to only wait a certain time for messages respectively.
 *
 * For almost every function there exist two variants, one that locks
 * the queue and one that doesn't. That way you can hold the queue lock
 * (acquire it with g_async_queue_lock() and release it with
 * g_async_queue_unlock()) over multiple queue accessing instructions.
 * This can be necessary to ensure the integrity of the queue, but should
 * only be used when really necessary, as it can make your life harder
 * if used unwisely. Normally you should only use the locking function
 * variants (those without the _unlocked suffix).
 *
 * In many cases, it may be more convenient to use #GThreadPool when
 * you need to distribute work to a set of worker threads instead of
 * using #GAsyncQueue manually. #GThreadPool uses a GAsyncQueue
 * internally.
