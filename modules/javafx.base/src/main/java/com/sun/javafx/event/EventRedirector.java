/**
 * This event dispatcher redirects received events to the registered child
 * dispatchers before dispatching them to the rest of the dispatch chain. The
 * redirected events are wrapped in {@code RedirectedEvent} instances, so they
 * can be easily recognized from normal direct events. If an original event
 * wrapped in the {@code RedirectedEvent} is consumed by any of the child
 * dispatchers, it won't be sent by the {@code EventRedirector} to the rest of
 * the original dispatch chain.
 * <p>
 * The child dispatchers can also be instances of {@code EventRedirector} and
 * might receive both, the normal events (from other sources) and the redirected
 * events from the parent {@code EventRedirector}. If a {@code RedirectedEvent}
 * is received, it is forwarded to the child event dispatchers without any
 * additional wrapping.
 * <p>
 * For this hierarchical arrangement of {@code EventRedirector} instances the
 * class defines the {@code handleRedirectedEvent} method, which is called with
 * a received redirected event, after the event has been forwarded to the child
 * dispatchers. By default this method is empty, but can be overridden in
 * derived classes to define specific handling of these redirected events.
