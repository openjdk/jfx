/// Defines conversion behaviors between `String` and other types. Each subclass defines a formatting (type to string)
/// and a parsing (string to type) behaviors. `StringConverter`s are usually used in controls for converting between the
/// underlying model (represented by type `T`) and the visual `String` representation.
///
/// Subclasses are provided for primitive wrapper types, numbers, dates and times, and custom formats.
///
/// @implNote
/// JavaFX's implementations follow these behaviors, which are not required by implementing classes:
/// - Except for `DefaultStringConverter`, formatting `null` returns an empty string, otherwise the type's `toString` is
/// used if it is suitable; parsing `null` or an empty string returns `null`.
/// - Immutable (the same converter can be reused).
///
/// @param <T> the type associated with the string conversions
/// @since JavaFX 2.0
public abstract class StringConverter<T> {

    /// Creates a default {@code StringConverter}.
