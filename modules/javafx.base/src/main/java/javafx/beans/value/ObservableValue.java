/**
 * An {@code ObservableValue} is an entity that wraps a value and allows to
 * observe the value for changes. In general this interface should not be
 * implemented directly but one of its sub-interfaces
 * ({@code ObservableBooleanValue} etc.).
 * <p>
 * The value of the {@code ObservableValue} can be requested with
 * {@link #getValue()}.
 * <p>
 * An implementation of {@code ObservableValue} may support lazy evaluation,
 * which means that the value is not immediately recomputed after changes, but
 * lazily the next time the value is requested (see note 1 in "Implementation Requirements").
 * <p>
 * An {@code ObservableValue} generates two types of events: change events and
 * invalidation events. A change event indicates that the value has changed
 * (see note 2 in "Implementation Requirements"). An
 * invalidation event is generated if the current value is not valid anymore.
 * This distinction becomes important if the {@code ObservableValue} supports
 * lazy evaluation, because for a lazily evaluated value one does not know if an
 * invalid value really has changed until it is recomputed. For this reason,
 * generating change events requires eager evaluation while invalidation events
 * can be generated for eager and lazy implementations.
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this class should strive to generate as few events as
 * possible to avoid wasting too much time in event handlers. Implementations in
 * this library mark themselves as invalid when the first invalidation event
 * occurs. They do not generate any more invalidation events until their value is
 * recomputed and valid again.
 * <p>
 * Two types of listeners can be attached to an {@code ObservableValue}:
 * {@link InvalidationListener} to listen to invalidation events and
 * {@link ChangeListener} to listen to change events.
 * <p>
 * Important note: attaching a {@code ChangeListener} enforces eager computation
 * even if the implementation of the {@code ObservableValue} supports lazy
 * evaluation.
 *
 * @param <T>
 *            The type of the wrapped value.

 * <li> All implementing classes in the JavaFX library check for a change using reference
 * equality (and not object equality, {@code Object#equals(Object)}) of the value.</li>
