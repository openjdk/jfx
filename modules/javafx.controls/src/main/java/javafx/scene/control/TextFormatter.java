/**
 * A Formatter describes a format of a {@code TextInputControl} text by using two distinct mechanisms:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>A filter ({@link #getFilter()}) that can intercept and modify user input. This helps to keep the text
 *     in the desired format. A default text supplier can be used to provide the initial text.</li>
 *     <li>A value converter ({@link #getValueConverter()}) and value ({@link #valueProperty()})
 *     can be used to provide special format that represents a value of type {@code V}.
 *     If the control is editable and the text is changed by the user, the value is then updated to correspond to the
 *     text.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * It's possible to have a formatter with just a filter or a value converter. If a value converter is not provided,
 * setting a value will result in an {@code IllegalStateException} and the value is always {@code null}.
 * <p>
 * Since {@code Formatter} contains a value that represents the state of the {@code TextInputControl} to which it is
 * currently assigned, a single {@code Formatter} instance can be used only in one {@code TextInputControl} at a time.
 *
 * @param <V> The type of the value

     * <p>
     *     This class contains state and convenience methods for determining what
     *     change occurred on the control. It also has a reference to the
     *     TextInputControl itself so that the developer may query any other
     *     state on the control. Note that you should never modify the state
     *     of the control directly from within the formatter handler.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     *     The Change of the text is described by <b>range</b> ({@link #getRangeStart()}, {@link #getRangeEnd()}) and
     *     text ({@link #getText()}. There are 3 cases that can occur:
     *     <ul>
     *         <li><b>Some text was deleted:</b> In this case, {@code text} is empty and {@code range} denotes the {@code range} of deleted text.
     *         E.g. In text "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet", removal of the second word would result in {@code range} being (6,11) and
     *         an empty {@code text}. Similarly, if you want to delete some different or additional text, just set the {@code range}.
     *         If you want to remove first word instead of the second, just call {@code setRange(0,5)}</li>
     *         <li><b>Some text was added:</b> Now the {@code range} is empty (means nothing was deleted), but it's value is still important.
     *         Both the start and end of the {@code range} point to the index wheret the new text was added. E.g. adding "ipsum " to "Lorem dolor sit amet"
     *         would result in a change with {@code range} of (6,6) and {@code text} containing the String "ipsum ".</li>
     *         <li><b>Some text was replaced:</b> The combination of the 2 cases above. Both {@code text} and {@code range} are not empty. The text in {@code range} is deleted
     *         and replaced by {@code text} in the Change. The new text is added instead of the old text, which is at the beginning of the {@code range}.
     *         E.g. when some text is being deleted, you can simply replace it by some placeholder text just by setting a new text
     *         ({@code setText("new text")})</li>
     *     </ul>
     * <p>
     *     The Change is mutable, but not observable. It should be used
     *     only for the life of a single change. It is intended that the
     *     Change will be modified from within the formatter.
