Updating libjpeg in OpenJFX:

1) Update the modules/javafx.graphics/src/main/legal/jpeg_fx.md file.
It would need updating the version at top, getting file header from
jcapimin.c (or consider using jversion.h), and part of the 'In legalese'
section from README.

2) Copy README file from the new version into OpenJFX's libjpeg source directory.

3) OpenJFX imports only the JPEG library source with some exceptions.
OpenJFX does not need any other applications or tools provided by IJG libjpeg.
Copy only the same 41 .c and 9 .h files as are already there.

4) The following files contain local modifications of libjpeg for JavaFX:
* jchuff.c
* jcinit.c
* jcmaster.c
* jctrans.c
* jdcolor.c
* jdhuff.c
* jdmaster.c
* jdtrans.c
* jerror.h
* jmorecfg.h

** The modifications are,
4.1) Remove arithmetic encoding/decoding.
Files: jcinit.c, jctrans.c, jdmaster.c, jdtrans.c, jerror.h, jmorecfg.h

4.2) Initialize arrays.
Files: jchuff.c, jcmaster.c, jdhuff.c

4.3) Add support for CMYK & YCCK jpeg color space.
Files: jdcolor.c
Two functions are added to jdcolor.c,
a) ycck_rgb_convert(): converts YCCK to RGB color space.
b) cmyk_rgb_convert(): converts CMYK to RGB color space.
Pointer to these functions is used while initializing decompressor.

4.4) Improve image filling.
Files: jdhuff.c

5) Expand tabs and remove trailing white spaces from source files.

6) Verification: FX sdk build and all test run, on all supported platforms.
