//
// 1. For fragment function buffer uniforms the offset must be:
//    - multiple of 8 on intel mac,
//    - multiple of 4 for Apple GPU family 2 to 9,
//    - multiple of 32 for Mac2
// 2. BlitEncoder offset: needs to be a multiple of the destination textureâ€™s pixel size.

// For more details see metal feature set table and doc of BlitEncoder.copyFromBuffer
