/**
 * This class provides base functionality for tracking and releasing native
 * d3d-related resources.
 *
 * When a Direct3D resource (such as texture, swap chain or pixel shader) is
 * created at the native level it is added to the list of resources (see
 * D3DResourceManager.cc) on both native and java level.
 *
 * This is needed because if a d3d device is lost
 * and needs to be reset we must release all resources created in the default
 * pool first. We must have references to all allocated resources in order to
 * do that. In some cases we need to release all resources (when the device
 * needs to be released, which may happen when a monitor is added or removed).
 *
 * There are several different ways a resource could be disposed of:
 *  - explicit disposal (dispose() is called) - the resource is released by the
 * resource manager at the native level, disposer record is updated to reflect
 * that
 *  - resource became unreachable - then the disposer will eventulally call
 * dispose() for this resource
 *  - resource is disposed of at the native level when trying to reset the
 * device. In this case the native code will call appropriate method to mark
 * default pool or all resources as released (the release itself will happen
 * at the native level) - see {@link D3DResourceManager}
 *
 * In all these cases resource disposal happens on the same thread (the
 * Rendering Thread).
 *
 * Note that some d3d-related resources are not derived from this class - like
 * D3DTexture. This is a bit confusing. But they do use this class's disposer
 * record (they must).
