/**
 * A dispatcher for Application.invokeLater() that submits deferred runnables
 * to the native system one by one.
 *
 * A native system may, by default, execute all submitted runnables before
 * actually leaving a nested event loop. However, there is an assumption that a
 * runnable that calls the Application.leaveNestedEventLoop() method must be
 * the last runnable executed in the current inner event loop. The next
 * runnable that might have already been submitted by client code must be
 * invoked in the context of the outer event loop. To satisfy this requirement,
 * the runnables must be submitted to the native system one by one. This allows
 * for a fine grained control over the execution of the deferred tasks when it comes to
 * entering/leaving nested event loops despite native system limitations.
