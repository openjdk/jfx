 * An implementation of {@link ShapePair} that represents the space between
 * two concentric, non-intersecting Shapes.  The pair of shapes could also be
 * represented by a regular {@link Path2D} by simply concatenating the two
 * shapes and using a {@code WIND_EVEN_ODD} winding rule.  (Note that a
 * {@code WIND_NON_ZERO} winding rule could be used if the two shapes have
 * opposite windings, but that cannot be guaranteed without further inspection
 * of the two shapes and the {@code WIND_NON_ZERO} rule works fine without
 * that restriction.)
