 * {@link #traverseToLast()} methods. These methods do the actual traversal - selecting the Node that's should be focused next and
 * focusing it. Also, listener calls are handled by top-most traversal engines.
 * select* methods can be used as well, but will *not* transfer the focus to the result, they are just query methods.
