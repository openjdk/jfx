/**
 * AbstractAsyncOperation.   Base class for result-bearing, asynchronous operations. Some operations are asynchronous
 * because they would potentially block the EDT for unacceptably long. Since JFX lacks a clear concurrency model,
 * allowing users to execute arbitrary JFX code in background threads would invariably cause problems.  Therefore,
 * we provide a number of Java classes for async operations, which will execute in a background thread, such as
 * "fetch a resource over the web".  Async operations should not access any JFX state except the immutable parameters
 * passed in, and should not have side effects other than those managed by thread-safe Java classes.
 *
 * Async operations are one-time use; subclasses should not attempt to reuse them.
