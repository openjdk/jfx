/**
 * An instance of ClipEnvelope handles the loop-part of a clip.
 *
 * The functionality to react on a pulse-signal from the timer is implemented in
 * two classes: ClipEnvelope and ClipCore. ClipEnvelope is responsible for the
 * "loop-part" (keeping track of the number of cycles, handling the direction of
 * the clip etc.). ClipCore takes care of the inner part (interpolating the
 * values, triggering the action-functions, ...)
 *
 * Both classes have an abstract public definition and can only be created using
 * the factory method create(). The intent is to provide a general
 * implementation plus eventually some fast-track implementations for common use
 * cases.
