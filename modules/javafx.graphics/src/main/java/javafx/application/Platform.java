     * This method starts the JavaFX runtime. The specified Runnable will then be
     * called on the JavaFX Application Thread. In general it is not necessary to
     * explicitly call this method, since it is invoked as a consequence of
     * how most JavaFX applications are built. However there are valid use cases
     * for calling this method directly. Because this method starts the JavaFX
     * runtime, there is not yet any JavaFX Application Thread, so it is normal
     * that this method is called directly on the main thread of the application.
     *
     * <p>
     * This method may or may not return to the caller before the run method
     * of the specified Runnable has been called. In any case, this
     * method is not blocked on the specified Runnable being executed.
     * Once this method
     * returns, you may call {@link #runLater(Runnable)} with additional Runnables.
     * Those Runnables will be called, also on the JavaFX Application Thread,
     * after the Runnable passed into this method has been called.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>As noted, it is normally the case that the JavaFX Application Thread
     * is started automatically. It is important that this method only be called
     * when the JavaFX runtime has not yet been initialized. Situations where
     * the JavaFX runtime is started automatically include:
     * </p>
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>For standard JavaFX applications that extend {@link Application}, and
     *   use either the Java launcher or one of the launch methods in the
     *   Application class to launch the application, the FX runtime is
     *   initialized automatically by the launcher before the {@code Application}
     *   class is loaded.</li>
     *   <li>For Swing applications that use {@link javafx.embed.swing.JFXPanel}
     *   to display FX content, the
     *   FX runtime is initialized when the first {@code JFXPanel} instance is
     *   constructed.</li>
     *   <li>For SWT application that use {@code FXCanvas} to display FX content,
     *   the FX runtime is initialized when the first {@code FXCanvas} instance is
     *   constructed.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>When an application does not follow any of these common approaches,
     * then it becomes the responsibility of the developer to manually start the
     * JavaFX runtime by calling this startup method.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>Calling this method when the JavaFX runtime is already running will result in an
     * {@link IllegalStateException} being thrown - it is only valid to request
     * that the JavaFX runtime be started once.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p><b>Note:</b> The JavaFX classes must be loaded from a set of
     * named {@code javafx.*} modules on the <em>module path</em>.
     * Loading the JavaFX classes from the classpath is not supported.
     * A warning is logged when the JavaFX runtime is started if the JavaFX
     * classes are not loaded from the expected named module.
     * This warning is logged regardless of whether the JavaFX runtime was
     * started by calling this method or automatically as described above.

     * A runnable passed into the runLater method will be

     * If this method is called after the JavaFX runtime has been shutdown, the

     * exception will be thrown.
     *
     * <p>
     * NOTE: applications should avoid flooding JavaFX with too many
     * pending Runnables. Otherwise, the application may become unresponsive.
     * Applications are encouraged to batch up multiple operations into fewer
