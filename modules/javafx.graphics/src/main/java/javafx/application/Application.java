/**
 * Application class from which JavaFX applications extend.
 *
 * <p><b>Life-cycle</b></p>
 * <p>
 * The entry point for JavaFX applications is the Application class. The
 * JavaFX runtime does the following, in order, whenever an application is
 * launched:
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>Starts the JavaFX runtime, if not already started
 * (see {@link Platform#startup(Runnable)} for more information)</li>
 * <li>Constructs an instance of the specified Application class</li>
 * <li>Calls the {@link #init} method</li>
 * <li>Calls the {@link #start} method</li>
 * <li>Waits for the application to finish, which happens when either of
 * the following occur:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the application calls {@link Platform#exit}</li>
 * <li>the last window has been closed and the {@code implicitExit}
 * attribute on {@code Platform} is true</li>
 * </ul></li>
 * <li>Calls the {@link #stop} method</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>Note that the {@code start} method is abstract and must be overridden.
 * The {@code init} and {@code stop} methods have concrete implementations
 * that do nothing.</p>
 * <p>The {@code Application} subclass must be declared public and must have a
 * public no-argument constructor.</p>
 *
 * <p>Calling {@link Platform#exit} is the preferred way to explicitly terminate
 * a JavaFX Application. Directly calling {@link System#exit} is
 * an acceptable alternative, but doesn't allow the Application {@link #stop}
 * method to run.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>A JavaFX Application should not attempt to use JavaFX after the
 * FX toolkit has terminated or from a ShutdownHook, that is, after the
 * {@link #stop} method returns or {@link System#exit} is called.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> The JavaFX classes must be loaded from a set of
 * named {@code javafx.*} modules on the <em>module path</em>.
 * Loading the JavaFX classes from the classpath is not supported.
 * See {@link Platform#startup(Runnable) Platform.startup}
 * for more information.
 *
 * <p><b>Deploying an Application as a Module</b></p>
 * <p>
 * If the {@code Application} subclass is in a named module then that class
 * must be accessible to the {@code javafx.graphics} module.
 * Otherwise, an exception will be thrown when the application is launched.
 * This means that
 * in addition to the class itself being declared public, the module must
 * {@link Module#isExported(String,Module) export}
 * (or {@link Module#isOpen(String,Module) open}) the containing package to
 * at least the {@code javafx.graphics} module.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example, if {@code com.foo.MyApplication} is in the {@code foo.app}
 * module, the {@code module-info.java} might look like this:
 * </p>
<pre>{@code module foo.app {
    exports com.foo to javafx.graphics;
}}</pre>
*
 * <p><b>Parameters</b></p>
 * <p>
 * Application parameters are available by calling the {@link #getParameters}
 * method from the {@link #init} method, or any time after the {@code init}
 * method has been called.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><b>Threading</b></p>
 * <p>
 * JavaFX creates an application thread for running the application start
 * method, processing input events, and running animation timelines. Creation
 * of JavaFX {@link Scene} and {@link Stage} objects as well as modification of
 * scene graph operations to <em>live</em> objects (those objects already
 * attached to a scene) must be done on the JavaFX application thread.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The Java launcher loads and initializes the specified Application class
 * on the JavaFX Application Thread. If there is no main method in the
 * Application class, or if the main method calls Application.launch(), then
 * an instance of the Application is then constructed on the JavaFX Application
 * Thread.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code init} method is called on the launcher thread, not on the
 * JavaFX Application Thread.
 * This means that an application must not construct a {@link Scene}
 * or a {@link Stage} in the {@code init} method.
 * An application may construct other JavaFX objects in the {@code init}
 * method.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * All the unhandled exceptions on the JavaFX application thread that occur during
 * event dispatching, running animation timelines, or any other code, are forwarded
 * to the thread's {@link java.lang.Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler uncaught
 * exception handler}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><b>Example</b></p>
 * <p>The following example will illustrate a simple JavaFX application.</p>
 * <pre>{@code
import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.scene.Group;
import javafx.scene.Scene;
import javafx.scene.shape.Circle;
import javafx.stage.Stage;

public class MyApp extends Application {
    public void start(Stage stage) {
        Circle circ = new Circle(40, 40, 30);
        Group root = new Group(circ);
        Scene scene = new Scene(root, 400, 300);

        stage.setTitle("My JavaFX Application");
        stage.setScene(scene);
        stage.show();
    }
}
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>The above example will produce the following:</p>
