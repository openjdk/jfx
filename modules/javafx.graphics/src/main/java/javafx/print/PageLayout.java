/**
 *
 * A PageLayout encapsulates the information needed to
 * lay out content. The reported width and height can be
 * considered equivalent to the clip enforced by a Window.
 * Applications that obtain a PageLayout instance will
 * need to inspect the width and height to perform layout and pagination.
 * Other information such as orientation and the Paper being used
 * and margins outside of this area are not needed for page rendering.
 * <p>
 * Printers usually have hardware margins where they cannot print.
 * A PageLayout instance obtained from a PrinterJob in the context
 * of a specific printer will be correctly set up to print over
 * the whole of that area. If an application adjusts the printable
 * area outside of this bounds, rendering to those areas will be
 * clipped by the device.
 * <p>
 * Within those hardware margins, the application may define any
 * printable area it needs. The resulting printable area will
 * define the effective dimensions
 * of the page available to the application at printing time.
 * <p>
 * Applying a PageLayout configured based on one printer,
 * to a job on a different printer may not work correctly,
 * as the second printer may not support the same margins, and may not
 * even support the same Paper. In such a case, the PageLayout must
 * be validated against the new printer.
 * <p>
 * A PageLayout is immutable.
