/**
 * <p>The ScheduledService is a {@link Service} that will automatically restart
 * itself after a successful execution, and under some conditions will
 * restart even in case of failure. A new ScheduledService begins in
 * the READY state, just as a normal Service. After calling
 * <code>start</code> or <code>restart</code>, the ScheduledService will
 * enter the SCHEDULED state for the duration specified by <code>delay</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>Once RUNNING, the ScheduledService will execute its Task. On successful
 * completion, the ScheduledService will transition to the SUCCEEDED state,
 * and then to the READY state and back to the SCHEDULED state. The amount
 * of time the ScheduledService will remain in this state depends on the
 * amount of time between the last state transition to RUNNING, and the
 * current time, and the <code>period</code>. In short, the <code>period</code>
 * defines the minimum amount of time from the start of one run and the start of
 * the next. If the previous execution completed before <code>period</code> expires,
 * then the ScheduledService will remain in the SCHEDULED state until the period
 * expires. If on the other hand the execution took longer than the
 * specified period, then the ScheduledService will immediately transition
 * back to RUNNING. </p>
 *
 * <p>If, while RUNNING, the ScheduledService's Task throws an error or in
 * some other way ends up transitioning to FAILED, then the ScheduledService
 * will either restart or quit, depending on the values for
 * <code>backoffStrategy</code>, <code>restartOnFailure</code>, and
 * <code>maximumFailureCount</code>.</p>
 *
 * <p>If a failure occurs and <code>restartOnFailure</code> is false, then
 * the ScheduledService will transition to FAILED and will stop. To restart
 * a failed ScheduledService, you must call <code>restart</code> manually.</p>
 *
 * <p>If a failure occurs and <code>restartOnFailure</code> is true, then
 * the the ScheduledService <em>may</em> restart automatically. First,
 * the result of calling <code>backoffStrategy</code> will become the
 * new <code>cumulativePeriod</code>. In this way, after each failure, you can cause
 * the service to wait a longer and longer period of time before restarting.
 * Once the task completes successfully, the cumulativePeriod is reset to
 * the value of <code>period</code>.</p>
 *
 * <p>ScheduledService defines static EXPONENTIAL_BACKOFF_STRATEGY and LOGARITHMIC_BACKOFF_STRATEGY
 * implementations, of which LOGARITHMIC_BACKOFF_STRATEGY is the default value for
 * <code>backoffStrategy</code>. After <code>maximumFailureCount</code> is reached, the
 * ScheduledService will transition to FAILED in exactly the same way as if
 * <code>restartOnFailure</code> were false.</p>
 *
 * <p>If the <code>period</code> or <code>delay</code> is changed while the
 * ScheduledService is running, the new values will be taken into account on the
 * next iteration. For example, if the <code>period</code> is increased, then the next time the
 * ScheduledService enters the SCHEDULED state, the new <code>period</code> will be used.
 * Likewise, if the <code>delay</code> is changed, the new value will be honored on
 * the next restart or reset/start.</p>
 *
 * The ScheduledService is typically used for use cases that involve polling. For
 * example, you may want to ping a server on a regular basis to see if there are
 * any updates. Such as ScheduledService might be implemented like this:
 *
 * <pre><code>
 * {@literal ScheduledService<Document> svc = new ScheduledService<Document>()} {
 *     {@literal protected Task<Document> createTask()} {
 *         {@literal return new Task<Document>()} {
 *             protected Document call() {
 *                 // Connect to a Server
 *                 // Get the XML document
 *                 // Parse it into a document
 *                 return document;
 *             }
 *         };
 *     }
 * };
 * svc.setPeriod(Duration.seconds(1));
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * This example will ping the remote server every 1 second.
 *
 * <p>Timing for this class is not absolutely reliable. A very busy event thread might introduce some timing
 * lag into the beginning of the execution of the background Task, so very small values for the period or
 * delay are likely to be inaccurate. A delay or period in the hundreds of milliseconds or larger should be
 * fairly reliable.</p>
 *
 * <p>The ScheduledService in its default configuration has a default <code>period</code> of 0 and a
 * default <code>delay</code> of 0. This will cause the ScheduledService to execute the task immediately
 * upon {@link #start()}, and re-executing immediately upon successful completion.</p>
 *
 * <p>For this purposes of this class, any Duration that answers true to {@link javafx.util.Duration#isUnknown()}
 * will treat that duration as if it were Duration.ZERO. Likewise, any Duration which answers true
 * to {@link javafx.util.Duration#isIndefinite()} will be treated as if it were a duration of Double.MAX_VALUE
 * milliseconds. Any {@code null} Duration is treated as {@code Duration.ZERO}. Any custom implementation of a backoff
 * strategy callback must be prepared to handle these different potential values.</p>
 *
 * <p>The ScheduledService introduces a new property called {@link #lastValueProperty() lastValue}. The
 * {@code lastValue} is the value that was last successfully computed. Because a Service clears its {@code value}
 * property on each run, and because the ScheduledService will reschedule a run immediately after completion (unless it
 * enters the cancelled or failed states), the value property is not overly useful on a ScheduledService. In most cases
 * you will want to instead use the value returned by {@code lastValue}.</p>
 *
 * @implNote The {@link #ready()}, {@link #scheduled()}, {@link #running()}, {@link #succeeded()},
 * {@link #cancelled()}, and {@link #failed()} methods are implemented in this class. Subclasses which also
 * override these methods must take care to invoke the super implementation.
