/**
 * <p>
 *     A Worker is an object which performs some work in one or more background
 *     threads, and whose state is observable and available to JavaFX applications
 *     and is usable from the main JavaFX Application thread. This interface is
 *     primarily implemented by both {@link Task} and {@link Service}, providing
 *     a common API among both classes which makes it easier for libraries and
 *     frameworks to provide workers which work well when developing user interfaces.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     A Worker may or may not be reusable depending on the implementation. A
 *     {@link Task}, for example, is not reusable while a {@link Service} is.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     A Worker has a well defined life cycle. Every Worker begins in the
 *     {@link State#READY} state. When the Worker has been scheduled for work
 *     (for example, when a Service's {@link javafx.concurrent.Service#start()}
 *     method is called), it is transitioned to {@link State#SCHEDULED}. Even
 *     Workers which are not technically scheduled, but started immediately
 *     (such as with {@link javafx.concurrent.Task#run()}) will transition through
 *     the {@link State#SCHEDULED} on its way to the {@link State#RUNNING} state.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     When the Worker is actually performing its work, the state will have been
 *     transitioned to {@link State#RUNNING}. If the Worker completes normally,
 *     it will end in the {@link State#SUCCEEDED} state, and the result of the
 *     Worker will be set as the <code>value</code> property. If however an Exception
 *     occurs during the execution of the Worker, then the state will be set to
 *     {@link State#FAILED} and the <code>exception</code> property will be set
 *     to the Exception which occurred.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     At any time prior to the conclusion of the Worker (that is, if the state
 *     is not already {@link State#SUCCEEDED} or {@link State#FAILED}) the developer
 *     may invoke the {@link javafx.concurrent.Worker#cancel()} method. If called, the
 *     Worker will cease execution (if possible, including use of Thread.interrupt)
 *     and the state changed to {@link State#CANCELLED}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     The only valid beginning state for a Worker is {@link State#READY}, and the
 *     valid ending states are {@link State#CANCELLED}, {@link State#SUCCEEDED},
 *     and {@link State#FAILED}. The <code>running</code> property is set to
 *     true when the state is either {@link State#SCHEDULED} or {@link State#RUNNING}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     The Worker's progress can be monitored via three different properties,
 *     <code>totalWork</code>, <code>workDone</code>, and <code>progress</code>.
 *     These properties are set by the actual implementation of the Worker
 *     interface, but can be observed by anybody. The <code>workDone</code> is
 *     a number between -1 (meaning indeterminate progress) and
 *     <code>totalWork</code>, inclusive. When <code>workDone == totalWork</code>
 *     the <code>progress</code> will be 100% (or 1). <code>totalWork</code>
 *     will be a number between -1 and Long.MAX_VALUE, inclusive. The progress
 *     will be either -1 (meaning indeterminate), or a value between 0 and 1, inclusive,
 *     representing 0% through 100%.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     A Worker which is in the {@link State#READY} or {@link State#SCHEDULED} states
 *     will always have <code>workDone</code> and <code>progress</code> set to -1.
 *     A Worker which is in the {@link State#SUCCEEDED} state will always have
 *     <code>workDone == totalWork</code> and <code>progress == 1</code>. In any
 *     other state, the values for these properties may be any value in their
 *     respective valid ranges.
 * </p>

    /**
     * <p>
     *     The state of a Worker. The state transitions in a Worker are very well defined.
     *     All Workers begin in the READY state. In some circumstances, a Worker might
     *     be scheduled for execution before it is actually executed. In such cases,
     *     it is sometimes useful to know when the Worker has been SCHEDULED separately
     *     from when it is RUNNING. However even in cases where the Worker is executed
     *     immediately, the Worker will temporarily enter the SCHEDULED state before
     *     entering the RUNNING state. That is, the transition is always from
     *     READY to SCHEDULED to RUNNING (unless of course the Worker in cancelled).
     * </p>
     * <p>
     *     A Worker which runs but is never cancelled can only end up in one of two
     *     states, either SUCCEEDED or FAILED. It only enters FAILED if an exception
     *     was thrown during the execution of the Worker. A Worker may be cancelled when
     *     READY, SCHEDULED, or RUNNING, in which case the final status will be CANCELLED.
     *     When a Worker is cancelled in one of these circumstances it will transition
     *     immediately to the CANCELLED state.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     *     A reusable Worker will transition from CANCELLED, SUCCEEDED or FAILED back to
     *     READY. From that point the normal state transitions are again followed.
