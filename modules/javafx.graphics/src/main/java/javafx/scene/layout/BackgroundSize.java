/**
 * Defines the size of the area that a BackgroundImage should fill relative
 * to the Region it is styling. There are several properties whose values
 * take precedence over the others. In particular there are 4 key properties,
 * {@code width}, {@code height}, {@code contain}, and {@code cover}. Both width
 * and height are independent of each other, however both interact with
 * contain and cover.
 * <p>
 * From the CSS Specification, {@code cover} is defined to:
 * <blockquote>
 * Scale the image, while preserving its intrinsic aspect ratio (if any), to the smallest size such that both
 * its width and its height can completely cover the background positioning area.
 * </blockquote>
 * {@code contain} is defined to:
 * <blockquote>
 * Scale the image, while preserving its intrinsic aspect ratio (if any), to the largest size such that both its
 * width and its height can fit inside the background positioning area.
 * </blockquote>
 * And width and height both specify (in absolute values or percentages) the size to use. These
 * two properties only apply if both cover and contain are false. If both cover and contain are true,
 * then {@code cover} will be used.
 * <p>
 * The width and height may also be set to {@code AUTO}, indicating that the area should be sized
 * so as to use the image's intrinsic size, or if it cannot be determined, 100%.
