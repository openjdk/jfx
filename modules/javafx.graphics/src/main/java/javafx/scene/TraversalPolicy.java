/**
 * The base class for any algorithm that determines focus traversal between elements in the
 * JavaFX scene graph.
 * <p>
 * In addition to the default traversal policy, which can be obtained via {@link #getDefault()}, a custom policy
 * can be set on via {@link Parent#setTraversalPolicy(TraversalPolicy)}, thus altering the traversal between
 * the children of that {@code Parent} and out of it.
 * <p>
 * Note that in order to avoid cycles or dead-ends in traversal the algorithms should respect the following order:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>For {@link TraversalDirection#NEXT NEXT}:
 *       node ->
 *       node subtree ->
 *       node siblings (first sibling then its subtree) ->
 *       {@link TraversalDirection#NEXT_IN_LINE NEXT_IN_LINE} for node's parent
 *   <li>For {@link TraversalDirection#NEXT_IN_LINE NEXT_IN_LINE}:
 *       node ->
 *       node siblings (first sibling then its subtree) ->
 *       {@link TraversalDirection#NEXT_IN_LINE NEXT_IN_LINE} for node's parent
 *   <li>For {@link TraversalDirection#PREVIOUS PREVIOUS}:
 *       node ->
 *       node siblings (first subtree then the node itself) ->
 *       {@link TraversalDirection#PREVIOUS PREVIOUS} for node's parent
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * This ensures that the next direction will traverse the same nodes as previous (in the opposite order).
