/**
 * Mouse drag events are delivered to potential gesture targets during
 * full press-drag-release gestures. The difference among different
 * gesture types is described at {@link javafx.scene.input.MouseEvent MouseEvent}.
 * <p>
 * Full press-drag-release gesture can be started by calling
 * {@code startFullDrag()} (on a node or scene) inside of a DRAG_DETECTED
 * event handler. This call activates delivering of {@code MouseDragEvent}s
 * to the nodes that are under cursor during the dragging gesture.
 * <p>
 * When you drag a node, it's still under cursor, so it is considered
 * being a potential gesture target during the whole gesture. If you need to
 * drag a node to a different node and let the other node know about it,
 * you need to ensure that the nodes under the dragged node are picked
 * as the potential gesture targets. You can achieve this by calling
 * {@code setMouseTransparent(true)} on the dragged node in a
 * {@code MOUSE_PRESSED} handler and returning it back to false in a
 * {@code MOUSE_RELEASED} handler. This way the nodes under the dragged
 * node will receive the {@code MouseDragEvent}s, while all the
 * {@code MouseEvent}s will still be delivered to the (currently mouse
 * transparent) gesture source.
 * <p>
 * The entered/exited events behave similarly to mouse entered/exited
 * events, please see {@link MouseEvent} overview.
