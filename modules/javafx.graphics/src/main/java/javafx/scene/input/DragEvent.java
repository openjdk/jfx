/**
 * Drag events replace mouse events during drag-and-drop gesture.
 * The difference between press-drag-release and drag-and-drop gestures
 * is described at {@link javafx.scene.input.MouseEvent MouseEvent}.
 * <p>
 * Drag and drop gesture can be started by calling {@code startDragAndDrop()}
 * (on a node or scene) inside of a {@link MouseEvent#DRAG_DETECTED DRAG_DETECTED} event handler.
 * The data to be transfered to drop target are placed to a {@code dragBoard}
 * at this moment.
 * <p>
 * Drag entered/exited events behave similarly to mouse entered/exited
 * events, please see {@code MouseEvent} overview.
 *
 * <h2>Drag sources: initiating a drag and drop gesture</h2>
 *
 * When a drag gesture is detected, an application can decide whether to
 * start a drag and drop gesture or continue with a press-drag-release gesture.
 * <p>
 * The default drag detection mechanism uses mouse movements with a pressed
 * button in combination with hysteresis. This behavior can be
 * augmented by the application. Each {@code MOUSE_PRESSED} and
 * {@code MOUSE_DRAGGED} event has a {@code dragDetect} flag that determines
 * whether a drag gesture has been detected. The default value of this flag
 * depends on the default detection mechanism and can be modified by calling
 * {@code setDragDetect()} inside of an event handler. When processing of
 * one of these events ends with the {@code dragDetect} flag set to true,
 * a {@code DRAG_DETECTED} {@code MouseEvent} is sent to the potential gesture
 * source (the object on which a mouse button has been pressed). This event
 * notifies about the gesture detection.
 * <p>
 * Inside a {@code DRAG_DETECTED} event handler, if the
 * {@code startDragAndDrop()} method is called on a node or scene and a dragged
 * data is made available to the returned {@code Dragboard}, the object on which
 * {@code startDragAndDrop()} has been called is considred a gesture source
 * and the drag and drop gesture is started. The {@code Dragboard} has system
 * clipboard functionality but is specifically used for drag and drop data
 * transfer.
 * <p>
 * The {@code startDragAndDrop()} method takes a set of {@code TransferMode}s
 * supported by the gesture source. For instance passing only
 * {@code TransferMode.COPY} indicates that the gesture source allows only
 * copying of the data, not moving or referencing.
 * <p>
 * Following example shows a simple drag and drop source:
 * <pre>
Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(100, 100);
rect.setOnDragDetected(new EventHandler&lt;MouseEvent&gt;() {
    &#64;Override public void handle(MouseEvent event) {
        Dragboard db = startDragAndDrop(TransferMode.ANY);
        ClipboardContent content = new ClipboardContent();
        content.putString("Hello!");
        db.setContent(content);
        event.consume();
    }
});
 * </pre>
 *
 * <br><h2>Potential drop targets</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * After the drag and drop gesture has been started, any object
 * ({@code Node}, {@code Scene}) over which the mouse is dragged is
 * a potential drop target.
 * <p>
 * When the mouse is dragged into the boundaries of potential drop target,
 * the potential target gets a {@code DRAG_ENTERED} event. When the mouse is
 * dragged outside of the potential target's bounds, it gets a
 * {@code DRAG_EXITED} event. There are also the bubbling
 * {@code DRAG_ENTERED_TARGET} and {@code DRAG_EXITED_TARGET} variants. They
 * behave similarly to mouse entered/exited events, please see
 * {@code MouseEvent} overview.
 * <p>
 * A potential drop target can decide to change its appearance to
 * let the user know that the dragged data can be dropped on it. This can be
 * done in a {@code DRAG_OVER} event handler, based on the position of the
 * mouse. Another option is to change the potential target's appearance in
 * a {@code DRAG_ENTERED} and {@code DRAG_EXITED} handlers.
 * <p>
 * In {@code DRAG_OVER} event handler a potential drop target has the ability
 * to make it known that it is an actual target. This is done by calling
 * {@code acceptTransferModes(TransferMode...)} on the event,
 * passing transfer modes it is willing to accept.
 * If it <i>is not called</i> during the event delivery or if none of the
 * passed transfer modes is supported by gesture source, then the potential
 * drop target <i>is not considered to be an actual drop target</i>.
 * <p>
 * When deciding weather to accept the event by calling {@code acceptTransferModes(TransferMode...)},
 * the type of data available on the {@code Dragboard} should be considered.
 * Access to the {@code Dragboard} is provided by the {@code getDragboard()}
 * method.
 * <p>
 * When accepting an event, the potential gesture target decides which
 * {@code TransferMode} is accepted for the operation. To make the decision,
 * {@code DragBoard.getTransferModes()} (set of transfer modes supported by
 * the gesture source) and {@code DragEvent.getTransferMode()} (default
 * transfer mode issued by platform, driven by key modifiers) can be used.
 * It is poosible to pass more transfer modes into the
 * {@code acceptTransferModes(TransferMode...)} method. In this case
 * it makes the decision in behalf of the
 * application (it chooses the default mode if it's supported by gesture source
 * and accepted by gesture target, otherwise it chooses the most common mode
 * of the supported and accepted ones).
 * The {@code DRAG_DROPPED} event's {@code getTransferMode()} later reports the
 * transfer mode accepted by the {@code DRAG_OVER} event handler.
 * <p>
 * A drag and drop gesture ends when the mouse button is released.
 * If this happens over a gesture target that accepted previous {@code DRAG_OVER}
 * events with a transfer mode supported by gesture source,
 * a {@code DRAG_DROPPED} event is sent to the gesture target.
 * In its handler, the gesture target can access the data on the dragboard.
 * After data has been transferred (or decided not to transfer), the gesture
 * needs to be completed by calling {@code setDropCompleted(Boolean)} on the event.
 * The {@code Boolean} argument indicates if the data has been transferred
 * successfully or not. If it is not called, the gesture is considered
 * unsuccessful.
 *
 * <p>
 * Following example shows a simple drag and drop target for text data:
 * <pre>
Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(100, 100);

rect.setOnDragOver(new EventHandler&lt;DragEvent&gt;() {
    &#64;Override public void handle(DragEvent event) {
        Dragboard db = event.getDragboard();
        if (db.hasString()) {
            event.acceptTransferModes(TransferMode.COPY_OR_MOVE);
        }
        event.consume();
    }
});

rect.setOnDragDropped(new EventHandler&lt;DragEvent&gt;() {
    &#64;Override public void handle(DragEvent event) {
        Dragboard db = event.getDragboard();
        boolean success = false;
        if (db.hasString()) {
            System.out.println("Dropped: " + db.getString());
            success = true;
        }
        event.setDropCompleted(success);
        event.consume();
    }
});
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Drag sources: finalizing drag and drop gesture</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * After the gesture has been finished, whether by successful or unsuccessful
 * data transfer or being canceled, the {@code DRAG_DONE} event is sent to
 * the gesture source. The {@code getTransferMode()} method of the event
 * indicates to the gesture source how the transfer of data was completed.
 * If the transfer mode has the value {@code MOVE}, then this allows the source
 * to clear out its data. Clearing the source's data gives the appropriate
 * appearance to a user that the data has been moved by the drag and drop
 * gesture. If it has the value {@code null}, then the drag and drop gesture
 * ended without any data being transferred.  This could happen as a result of
 * a mouse release event over a node that is not a drop target, or the user
 * pressing the ESC key to cancel the drag and drop gesture, or by
 * the gesture target reporting an unsuccessful data transfer.
 * </p>
