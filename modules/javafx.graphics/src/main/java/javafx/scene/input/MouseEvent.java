/**
 * When a mouse event occurs, the top-most node under cursor is picked and
 * the event is delivered to it through capturing and bubbling phases
 * described at {@link javafx.event.EventDispatcher EventDispatcher}.
 * <p>
 * The mouse (pointer's) location is available relative to several
 * coordinate systems: x,y - relative to the origin of the
 * MouseEvent's node, sceneX,sceneY - relative to to the
 * origin of the {@code Scene} that contains the node,
 * screenX,screenY - relative to origin of the screen that
 * contains the mouse pointer.
 *
 * <h2>Dragging gestures</h2>
 * <p>
 * There are three types of dragging gestures. They are all initiated by
 * a mouse press event and terminated as a result of a mouse released
 * event, the source node decides which gesture will take place.
 * <p>
 * The simple press-drag-release gesture is default. It's best used to allow
 * changing size of a shape, dragging it around and so on. Whole
 * press-drag-release gesture is delivered to one node. When a mouse
 * button is pressed, the top-most node is picked and all subsequent
 * mouse events are delivered to the same node until the button is released.
 * If a mouse clicked event is generated from these events, it is still
 * delivered to the same node.
 * <p>
 * During simple press-drag-release gesture, the other nodes are not involved
 * and don't get any events. If these nodes need to be involved in the gesture,
 * full press-drag-release gesture has to be activated. This gesture is
 * best used for connecting nodes by "wires", dragging nodes to other nodes etc.
 * This gesture type is more closely described at
 * {@link javafx.scene.input.MouseDragEvent MouseDragEvent} which contains
 * the events delivered to the gesture targets.
 * <p>
 * The third gesture type is platform-supported drag-and-drop gesture. It serves
 * best to transfer data and works also between (not necessarily FX)
 * applications. This gesture type is more closely described
 * at {@link javafx.scene.input.DragEvent DragEvent}.
 * <p>
 * In a short summary, simple press-drag-release gesture is activated
 * automatically when a mouse button is pressed and delivers all
 * {@code MouseEvent}s to the gesture source. When you start dragging,
 * eventually the {@code DRAG_DETECTED} event arrives. In its handler
 * you can either start full press-drag-release gesture by calling
 * {@code startFullDrag} method on a node or scene - the {@code MouseDragEvent}s
 * start to be delivered to gesture targets, or you can start drag and drop
 * gesture by calling {@code startDragAndDrop} method on a node or scene -
 * the system switches into the drag and drop mode and {@code DragEvent}s start
 * to be delivered instead of {@code MouseEvent}s. If you don't call any of
 * those methods, the simple press-drag-release gesture continues.
 * <p>
 * Note that dragging a finger over touch screen produces mouse dragging events,
 * but also scroll gesture events. If it means a conflict in an application
 * (the physical dragging action is handled by two different handlers), the
 * {@code isSynthesized()} method may be used to detect the problem and make the
 * dragging handlers behave accordingly.
 *
 * <h2>Mouse enter/exit handling</h2>
 * <p>
 * When the mouse enters a node, the node gets {@code MOUSE_ENTERED} event, when
 * it leaves, it gets {@code MOUSE_EXITED} event. These events are delivered
 * only to the entered/exited node and seemingly don't go through the
 * capturing/bubbling phases. This is the most common use-case.
 * <p>
 * When the capturing or bubbling is desired, there are
 * {@code MOUSE_ENTERED_TARGET}/{@code MOUSE_EXITED_TARGET} events. These events
 * go through capturing/bubbling phases normally. This means that parent may
 * receive the {@code MOUSE_ENTERED_TARGET} event when the mouse entered
 * either the parent itself or some of its children. To distinguish between
 * these two cases, the event target can be tested on equality with the node.
 * <p>
 * These two types are closely connected:
 * {@code MOUSE_ENTERED}/{@code MOUSE_EXITED} are subtypes
 * of {@code MOUSE_ENTERED_TARGET}/{@code MOUSE_EXITED_TARGET}.
 * During capturing phase,
 * {@code MOUSE_ENTERED_TARGET} is delivered to the
 * parents. When the event is delivered to the event target (the node that
 * has actually been entered), its type is switched to
 * {@code MOUSE_ENTERED}. Then the type is switched back to
 * {@code MOUSE_ENTERED_TARGET} for the bubbling phase.
 * It's still one event just switching types, so if it's filtered or consumed,
 * it affects both event variants. Thanks to the subtype-relationship, a
 * {@code MOUSE_ENTERED_TARGET} event handler will receive the
 * {@code MOUSE_ENTERED} event on target.
 *
