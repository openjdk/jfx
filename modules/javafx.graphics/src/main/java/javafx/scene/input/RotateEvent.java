/**
 * Rotate event indicates that user performed rotating gesture such as
 * dragging two fingers around each other on track pad,
 * touch screen or other similar device.
 * <p>
 * The event is delivered to the top-most
 * node picked on the gesture coordinates in time of the gesture start - the
 * whole gesture is delivered to the same node even if the coordinates change
 * during the gesture.
 * <p>
 * The event provides two values: {@code angle} is the rotation angle of this
 * event, {@code totalAngle} is the rotation angle of the whole gesture. Both
 * values are in degrees and work well when added to the node's {@code rotate}
 * property value (positive values for clockwise rotation).
 * <p>
 * As all gestures, rotation can be direct (performed directly at
 * the concrete coordinates as on touch screen - the center point among all
 * the touches is usually used as the gesture coordinates) or indirect (performed
 * indirectly as on track pad - the mouse cursor location is usually used
 * as the gesture coordinates).
 * <p>
 * The gesture's {@code ROTATE} events are surounded by {@code ROTATION_STARTED}
 * and {@code ROTATION_FINISHED} events. If rotation inertia is active on the
 * given platform, some {@code ROTATE} events with {@code isInertia()} returning
 * {@code true} can come after {@code ROTATION_FINISHED}.
