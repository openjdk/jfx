/**
 * Touch point represents a single point of a multi-touch action, typically
 * one finger touching a screen. It is contained in {@link TouchEvent}.
 * <p>
 * The touch point has its coordinates, state (see {@link State}) and ID. The
 * ID is sequential number of this touch point unique in scope of a single
 * multi-touch gesture.
 * <p>
 * Each touch point is by default delivered to a single node during its whole
 * trajectory - to the node on which it was pressed. There is a grabbing API
 * to modify this behavior. The above means that when touch point is pressed,
 * it is automatically grabbed by the top-most node on the press coordinates.
 * Any time during the gesture {@code grab()} and {@code ungrab()} methods
 * can be used to alter the event delivery target. When grabbed by a different
 * node, it will next time be targeted to it; when ungrabbed, it will be
 * always targeted to the top-most node on the current location.
