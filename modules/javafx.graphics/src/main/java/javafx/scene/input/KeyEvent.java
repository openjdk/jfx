/**
 * An event which indicates that a keystroke occurred in a {@link javafx.scene.Node}.
 * <p>
 * This event is generated when a key is pressed, released, or typed.
 * Depending on the type of the event it is passed
 * to {@link javafx.scene.Node#onKeyPressedProperty onKeyPressed}, {@link javafx.scene.Node#onKeyTypedProperty onKeyTyped}
 * or {@link javafx.scene.Node#onKeyReleasedProperty onKeyReleased} function.
 *
 * <p>
 * <em>"Key typed" events</em> are higher-level and generally do not depend on
 * the platform or keyboard layout.  They are generated when a Unicode character
 * is entered, and are the preferred way to find out about character input.
 * In the simplest case, a key typed event is produced by a single key press
 * (e.g., 'a').  Often, however, characters are produced by series of key
 * presses (e.g., SHIFT + 'a'), and the mapping from key pressed events to
 * key typed events may be many-to-one or many-to-many.  Key releases are not
 * usually necessary to generate a key typed event, but there are some cases
 * where the key typed event is not generated until a key is released (e.g.,
 * entering ASCII sequences via the Alt-Numpad method in Windows).
 * No key typed events are generated for keys that don't generate Unicode
 * characters (e.g., action keys, modifier keys, etc.).
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code character} variable always contains a valid Unicode character(s)
 * or CHAR_UNDEFINED. Character input is reported by key typed events;
 * key pressed and key released events are not necessarily associated
 * with character input. Therefore, the {@code character} variable
 * is guaranteed to be meaningful only for key typed events.
 *
 * <p>
 * For key pressed and key released events, the {@code code} variable contains
 * the event's key code.  For key typed events, the {@code code} variable
 * always contains {@code KeyCode.UNDEFINED}.
 *
 * <p>
 * <em>"Key pressed" and "key released" events</em> are lower-level and depend
 * on the platform and keyboard layout. They are generated whenever a key is
 * pressed or released, and are the only way to find out about keys that don't
 * generate character input (e.g., action keys, modifier keys, etc.). The key
 * being pressed or released is indicated by the code variable, which contains
 * a virtual key code.
 *
 * <p>
 * For triggering context menus see the {@link ContextMenuEvent}.
