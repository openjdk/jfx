/**
 * Zoom event indicates that user performed zooming gesture such as
 * dragging two fingers apart on track pad, touch screen or other
 * similar device.
 * <p>
 * The event is delivered to the top-most
 * node picked on the gesture coordinates in time of the gesture start - the
 * whole gesture is delivered to the same node even if the coordinates change
 * during the gesture.
 * <p>
 * The event provides two values: {@code zoomFactor} is the zooming amount
 * of this event, {@code totalZoomFactor} is the zooming amount of the whole
 * gesture. The values work well when multiplied with the node's {@code scale}
 * properties (values greater than {@code 1} for zooming in).
 * <p>
 * As all gestures, zooming can be direct (performed directly at
 * the concrete coordinates as on touch screen - the center point among all
 * the touches is usually used as the gesture coordinates) or indirect (performed
 * indirectly as on track pad - the mouse cursor location is usually used
 * as the gesture coordinates).
 * <p>
 * The gesture's {@code ZOOM} events are surounded by {@code ZOOM_STARTED}
 * and {@code ZOOM_FINISHED} events. If zooming inertia is active on the
 * given platform, some {@code ZOOM} events with {@code isInertia()} returning
 * {@code true} can come after {@code ZOOM_FINISHED}.
