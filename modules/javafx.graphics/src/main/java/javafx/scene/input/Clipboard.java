/**
 * Represents an operating system clipboard, on which data may be placed during, for
 * example, cut, copy, and paste operations.
 * <p>
 * To access the general system clipboard, use the following code:
 * <pre>{@code
 *     Clipboard clipboard = Clipboard.getSystemClipboard();
 * }</pre>
 * <p>
 * There is only ever one instance of the system clipboard in the application, so it is
 * perfectly acceptable to stash a reference to it somewhere handy if you so choose.
 * <p>
 * The Clipboard operates on the concept of having a single conceptual item on the
 * clipboard at any one time -- though it may be placed on the clipboard in different
 * formats. For example, the user might select text in an HTML editor and press the
 * ctrl+c or cmd+c to copy it. In this case, the same text might be available on the
 * clipboard both as HTML and as plain text. There are two copies of the data on the
 * clipboard, but they both represent the same data.
 * <p>
 * Content is specified on the Clipboard by using the {@link #setContent}
 * method. First, construct a ClipboardContent object, then invoke setContent. Every time
 * setContent is called, any previous data on the clipboard is cleared and replaced with
 * this new content.
 * <pre><code>
 *     final Clipboard clipboard = Clipboard.getSystemClipboard();
 *     final ClipboardContent content = new ClipboardContent();
 *     content.putString("Some text");
 *     {@literal content.putHtml("<b>Some</b> text")};
 *     clipboard.setContent(content);
 * </code></pre>
 * <p>
 * The {@link ClipboardContent} class is simply a map with convenience methods for dealing
 * with common data types added to a clipboard.
 * <p>
 * Because multiple representations of the same data may exist on the clipboard, and because
 * different applications have different capabilities for handling different content types,
 * it is important to place as many data representations on the clipboard as is practical to
 * facilitate external applications. Note that sometimes the operating system might be
 * helpful in some cases and add multiple types for you. For example, the Mac might set the
 * plain text string for you when you specify the RTF type. How and under what circumstances
 * this occurs is outside the realm of this specification, consult your OS documentation.
 * <p>
 * When reading data off the clipboard, it is important to look for the richest
 * supported type first. For example, if I have a text document which supports embedding of
 * images and media formats, when pasting content from the clipboard I should first check to
 * see if the content can be represented as media or as an image. If not, then I might check
 * for RTF or HTML or whatever rich text format is supported by my document type. If not,
 * then I might just take a String.
 * <p>
 * Or for example, if I have a plain text document, then I would simple get a String
 * representation and use that, if available. I can check to see if the clipboard "hasHtml"
 * or "hasString".
 * <pre>{@code
 *     if (clipboard.hasString()) { ... }
 * }</pre>
 * <p>
 * In addition to the common or built in types, you may put any arbitrary data onto the
 * clipboard (assuming it is serializable).
 * <p>
 * Content types are defined by the DataFormat objects.
 * The DataFormat class defines an immutable object, and there are a number of static final
 * fields for common DataFormat types. Of course application specific DataFormat types can also be
 * declared and used. The following two methods are equivalent (and the second call
 * will override the first!)
 * <pre>{@code
 *     ClipboardContent content = new ClipboardContent();
 *     content.putString("some text");
 *     content.put(DataFormat.PLAIN_TEXT, "other text");
 * }</pre>
 * <p>
 * On embedded platforms that do not have their own windowing system, the
 * Clipboard returned from Clipboard.getSystemClipboard() might not be
 * accessible from outside the JavaFX application.
 *</p>
 * <p>
 * If a security manager is present, the application must have the
 * {@link javafx.util.FXPermission} "accessClipboard" in order for the
 * Clipboard returned from Clipboard.getSystemClipboard() to be
 * accessible from outside the JavaFX application. For compatibility with
 * previous versions of the JDK the equivalent {@code AWTPermission}
 * "accessClipboard" will also allow the FX clipboard to be accessible from
 * outside the JavaFX application.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If the application lacks permission or if the platform doesn't support
 * a shared clipboard, the clipboard
 * returned by Clipboard.getSystemClipboard() can be used for exchange of data
 * between different parts of one JavaFX application but cannot be used to
 * exchange data between multiple applications.
 * </p>
 *
 * @since JavaFX 2.0

     * JavaFX supports the concept of multiple independently named clipboards. There is a
     * predefined clipboard which represents the main system clipboard, but it is possible
     * to create custom clipboards if you so desire. Some platforms, such as Mac OS X,
     * define a number of different named clipboards. You can access these from JavaFX by
     * simply creating a Clipboard with the correct name. Typically there is no need to do
     * so in your applications since the UI Controls will use the correct System clipboards,
     * if applicable.
     * <p>
     *
     * Sometimes you may want to put a reference to a data representation on the clipboard
     *
     * rather than the data itself. For example, the user may have selected a large block of
     * text, and wants to copy this to the clipboard. Instead of having to actually produce
     * multiple copies of this text, a reference can be placed on the clipboard instead. When
     * the developer subsequently attempts to read the value off the clipboard, this reference
     * is resolved. Or suppose that I want to put a Node on the clipboard, such that the
     * representation of that Node on the clipboard is as an image.
     * <pre>{@code
     *     final Node node = ...;
     *     ClipboardReference ref = new ClipboardReference() {
     *         @Override public InputStream get() {
     *             // convert the node to an image
     *             // return an input stream to the image
     *             ...
     *         }
     *     };
     *     clipboard.putReference(DataFormat.IMAGE_TIFF, ref);
     * }</code>
     * <p>
     * At the appropriate time, a client reading off the clipboard will ask for the data and
     * the system will invoke the provided callback to stream the image data over to the client.
