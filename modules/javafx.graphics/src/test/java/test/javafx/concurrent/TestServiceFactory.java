/**
 * The Task and Service tests need to do a little trickery due to threading.
 * Although in practice they run on different threads (ie: the UI and
 * background threads), while testing I want to be able to run predictably
 * and quickly on just the test thread. This implementation of
 * Service is used as the base implementation of all Services which are
 * tested. It will simply run the given command immediately, and makes
 * sure the checkThread does nothing.
