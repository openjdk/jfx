 * In this test, the Task is going to attempt to totally swamp the
 * Event Queue by posting message updates very rapidly (that is,
 * the background threaded code isn't going to worry about it,
 * it is just going to send progress updates thousands of times
 * each second, and it is up to the Task implementation to
 * coalesce these down into a very sustainable number of entries
 * on the event queue. Basically, there should only ever be one
 * event on the event queue which gets the most recent value).
