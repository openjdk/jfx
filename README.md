# OpenJFX

OpenJFX is an open source, next generation client application platform for desktop, mobile and embedded systems based on JavaSE. It is a collaborative effort by many individuals and companies with the goal of producing a modern, efficient, and fully featured toolkit for developing rich client applications. This is the open source project where we develop JavaFX.

OpenJFX is free software, licensed under [GPL v2 with the Classpath exception](LICENSE), just like the JDK. Anybody is welcome to contribute to this project, port it to other platforms or devices, or do anything else that a free software license allows you to do!

OpenJFX is a project under the charter of the OpenJDK. The [OpenJDK Bylaws](https://openjdk.org/bylaws) and [License](LICENSE) govern our work. The OpenJFX project membership can be found on the [OpenJDK Census](https://openjdk.org/census#openjfx). We welcome patches and involvement from individual contributors or companies. If this is your first time contributing to an OpenJDK project, you will need to review the rules on [becoming a Contributor](https://openjdk.org/bylaws#contributor), and sign the [Oracle Contributor Agreement](https://oca.opensource.oracle.com/) (OCA).
