# OpenJFX

KCR says: this change is not intended to be made. I am only testing the Skara handling of Confidential bugs.

OpenJFX is an open source, next generation client application platform for desktop, mobile and embedded systems based on JavaSE. It is a collaborative effort by many individuals and companies with the goal of producing a modern, efficient, and fully featured toolkit for developing rich client applications. This is the open source project where we develop JavaFX.

OpenJFX is free software, licensed under [GPL v2 with the Classpath exception](LICENSE), just like the JDK. Anybody is welcome to contribute to this project, port it to other platforms or devices, or do anything else that a free software license allows you to do!

OpenJFX is a project under the charter of the OpenJDK. The [OpenJDK Bylaws](https://openjdk.java.net/bylaws) and [License](LICENSE) govern our work. The OpenJFX project membership can be found on the [OpenJDK Census](https://openjdk.java.net/census#openjfx). We welcome patches and involvement from individual contributors or companies. If this is your first time contributing to an OpenJDK project, you will need to review the rules on [becoming a Contributor](https://openjdk.java.net/bylaws#contributor), and sign the [Oracle Contributor Agreement](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/community/oca-486395.html) (OCA).

## Issue tracking

If you think you have found a bug in OpenJFX, first make sure that you are testing against the latest version - your issue may already have been fixed. If not, search our [issues list](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net) in the Java Bug System (JBS) in case a similar issue has already been opened. More information on where and how to report a bug can be found at [bugreport.java.com](https://bugreport.java.com/).
