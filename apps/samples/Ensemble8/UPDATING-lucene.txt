To update to a new version of Lucene:

1. Change the version number in the following files:
    apps/samples/.classpath
    apps/samples/Ensemble8/build.gradle
    apps/samples/Ensemble8/legal/lucene.md
    apps/samples/Ensemble8/nbproject/project.properties
    build.gradle


2. Do a clean build of apps:

    gradle clean
    gradle sdk apps

NOTE: if upgrading to a new major version there are usually compilation or runtime errors that need to be fixed.


3. Regenerate the index files. This step can be skipped if only the "bugfix" number (the third digit) of the release changes:

$ cd apps/samples/Ensemble8
$ rm -rf src/generated/resources/ensemble/search/index
$ ant -Dplatforms.JDK_1.9.home=$JAVA_HOME clean ensemble-generate-search-index jar
$ rm src/generated/resources/ensemble/search/index/write.lock
$ git add --all src/generated/resources/ensemble/search/index


4. Test it by running Ensemble and entering text into the search box (upper right)
