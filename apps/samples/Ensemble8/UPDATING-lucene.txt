To update to a new version of Lucene:

1. Change the version number in the following files:
    apps/samples/.classpath
    apps/samples/Ensemble8/build.gradle
    apps/samples/Ensemble8/legal/lucene.md
    apps/samples/Ensemble8/nbproject/project.properties
    build.gradle


2. Do a clean build of apps:

    gradle clean
    gradle sdk apps

NOTE: if upgrading to a new major version there are usually compilation errors that need to be fixed.


3. Regenerate the index files:

$ cd apps/samples/Ensemble8
$ rm -rf src/generated/resources/ensemble/search/index
$ ant -Dplatforms.JDK_1.9.home=$JAVA_HOME clean ensemble-generate-search-index jar
$ rm src/generated/resources/ensemble/search/index/write.lock
$ git add --all src/generated/resources/ensemble/search/index


4. Test it by running Ensemble and entering text into the search box (upper right)
